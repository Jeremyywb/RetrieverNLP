  "explanation": "Correct calculation for Tom's points:\n- Distance of (3, -2): \u221a(3\u00b2 + (-2)\u00b2) = \u221a13\n- Distance of (2, -3): \u221a(2\u00b2 + (-3)\u00b2) = \u221a13  \nThese are equal.\n\nCorrect calculation for Katie's points:\n- Distance of (4, 1): \u221a(4\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = \u221a17\n- Distance of (7, -2): \u221a(7\u00b2 + (-2)\u00b2) = \u221a53  \nThese are unequal.\n\nStudent's error: The student likely compared coordinates directly without squaring terms, concluding (3, -2) \u2260 (2, -3) implies unequal distances. Similarly, they assumed (4, 1) and (7, -2) must have unequal distances due to differing coordinates. This shows they treated coordinate differences as linear measures rather than applying Pythagoras' theorem to calculate diagonal distances.\n\nThe misconception caused the student to equate distinct coordinates with distinct distances without mathematical verification. They prioritized coordinate comparison over geometric distance computation. This aligns with failing to link Pythagoras' theorem to coordinate distances, not merely estimation errors (which would still require some spatial reasoning) or arithmetic mistakes with signs (which aren't demonstrated here).\n\nThe error is distinct from origin misinterpretation (explicitly stated in the problem) or miscalculating term inclusion (no evidence of adding coordinates instead of squaring them).",
