  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \nMultiply both terms by 4 (LCM of denominators) to eliminate fractions:  \n\\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4 = 1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2\\) \u2192 Ratio = \\(1:2\\).\n\nStudent's calculation:  \nResult \\(2:4\\) suggests they may have doubled both terms of the correct answer (\\(1:2 \\times 2 = 2:4\\)) or multiplied the original fractions by 8 instead of 4. \n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student recognized the need to convert to integers but used an unnecessarily large multiplier (e.g., 8 instead of 4). This produced \\(2:4\\), which they failed to reduce further by dividing by the GCD (2). \n\nMisconception link:  \nThe error stems from stopping at an equivalent but non-simplified ratio rather than applying the final simplification step, despite already having integer terms. \n\nDistinction:  \nThis differs from misunderstanding fraction operations or order, as the student correctly preserved the ratio's value but omitted the last critical simplification step.",
