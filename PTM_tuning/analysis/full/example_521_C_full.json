  "explanation": "The correct pattern adds 2 circles each term: 8 \u2192 10 \u2192 12... The student likely calculated 8 + 4 = 12. \n\nTheir error stems from observing a partial pattern (possibly counting added columns/rows instead of total circles). If the initial term was structured as two groups of 4 circles (e.g., two rows of 4), they might have incorrectly assumed the next term adds another identical group (4 more circles) rather than incrementing each group by 1 (2 more total). \n\nThis matches the primary misconception of identifying an incorrect additive pattern (assuming +4 per term) rather than recognizing the actual +2 progression. It specifically involves misapplying arithmetic based on structural misinterpretation, distinct from errors like overlooking term positions or defaulting to standard arithmetic sequences without visual analysis.",
