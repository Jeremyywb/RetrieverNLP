  "explanation": "To factorise \\(p^2 + 2p + 3\\), one seeks integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\cdot b = 3\\) (constant term) and \\(a + b = 2\\) (coefficient of \\(p\\)). No such integers exist, as the factors of 3 (3,1 or -3,-1) sum to 4 or -4, not 2. \n\nThe student likely chose 3 and -1 because \\(3 + (-1) = 2\\), but their product is \\(-3 \\neq 3\\). This shows they prioritized achieving the correct sum while disregarding the required product. \n\nThe error stems from focusing solely on matching the middle term's coefficient without ensuring the product equals the constant term. This distinguishes it from misconceptions about sign handling or swapping sum/product requirements, as the student explicitly used additive pairing while ignoring multiplicative constraints.",
