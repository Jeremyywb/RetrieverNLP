  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes that while all rhombuses are parallelograms, not all parallelograms are rhombuses. A rhombus requires four equal sides, whereas a parallelogram only requires two pairs of parallel sides. \n\nThe student incorrectly concluded \"Both\" by assuming parallelogram classification automatically satisfies rhombus requirements. This stems from misapplying subset relationships - they treated rhombus and parallelogram as overlapping categories rather than a strict hierarchy where rhombuses are a special case. \n\nThe error specifically shows failure to recognize that additional constraints (equal side lengths) must be verified for the parallelogram to qualify as a rhombus. This directly aligns with hierarchical relationship misunderstandings rather than property misconceptions like side equality quantity or angle requirements. \n\nThe student didn't distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions for subcategories, unlike errors about perpendicular sides or single-pair equality which would involve different property misunderstandings. Their reasoning stopped at the shared parallel sides feature without progressing to check rhombus-specific criteria.",
