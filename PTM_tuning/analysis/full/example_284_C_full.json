  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 60302 = 6*10,000 + 0*1,000 + 3*100 + 0*10 + 2 = \"sixty thousand three hundred two.\"\n\nStudent's error: Interpreted the digits after 60,000 as 032 (thirty-two) instead of 302 (three hundred two). They treated the 3 (hundreds place) and 2 (ones place) as consecutive digits in the tens/ones positions, skipping the zero in the tens place.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student failed to recognize that the middle zero maintains the hundreds place separation. By collapsing 3-0-2 into 32, they ignored the placeholder function of the zero between the 3 and 2, merging distinct place values.\n\nMisconception link: This directly stems from misunderstanding zeros as inactive placeholders. The student treated zeros as nonexistent rather than positional separators, allowing them to improperly combine the 3 (hundreds) and 2 (ones) across a zero.\n\nDistinguishing factors: This isn't a right-to-left reading error (digits weren't reversed) or a ten-thousands/thousands confusion (the \"sixty thousand\" part was correct). The error specifically occurred in handling intermediate zeros and place values.",
