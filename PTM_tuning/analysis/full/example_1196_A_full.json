  "explanation": "To solve \\( p^2 - 16 = p \\) using the quadratic formula, one must first rearrange it to standard form \\( p^2 - p - 16 = 0 \\) by subtracting \\( p \\) from both sides. The student instead proposed \"square rooting everything,\" likely interpreting \\( p^2 - 16 \\) as a perfect square akin to \\( a^2 - b^2 \\), despite the equation not being set to zero. This misapplication assumes the equation simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{p^2 - 16} = \\sqrt{p} \\), which incorrectly treats subtraction under a square root as a valid algebraic step. The error stems from conflating isolated squared terms (e.g., \\( p^2 = k \\)) with non-isolated quadratic expressions, bypassing the need to first isolate all terms. This aligns with misidentifying quadratic structures but differs from errors like squaring both sides (unrelated to this operation) or unbalanced equation manipulation (which would involve unequal term adjustments).",
