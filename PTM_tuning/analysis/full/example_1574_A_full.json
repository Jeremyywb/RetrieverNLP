  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (6 + 28) \u00d7 4 = 34 \u00d7 4 = 136  \nStudent's calculation: 6 + 28 = 34  \n\nThe student correctly calculated the weekly total (\u00a334) but failed to multiply it by 4 weeks. Their reasoning stopped at the first step of adding individual weekly expenses, neglecting the requirement to scale this sum across the repeated time period specified in the problem. This reflects a failure to process the temporal repetition implied by \"every week for 4 weeks\" as requiring multiplication.  \n\nThe error differs from \"adds instead of multiplies\" because the student never attempted multiplication - they omitted it entirely. It also differs from general arithmetic errors, as the addition itself was performed correctly but incompletely applied.",
