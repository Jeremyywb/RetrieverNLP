  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n1. Square side = \u221a196 = 14 cm\n2. Square contributes 3 sides (14 \u00d7 3 = 42 cm)\n3. Pentagon contributes 4 sides (14 \u00d7 4 = 56 cm)\n4. Total perimeter = 42 + 56 = 98 cm\n\nStudent's Likely Calculation:\n1. Correctly found square side: 14 cm\n2. Assumed pentagon side \u2260 square side, but used 14 cm anyway (correct)\n3. Incorrectly counted all 5 pentagon sides (14 \u00d7 5 = 70 cm)\n4. Added square's 4 sides (14 \u00d7 4 = 56 cm)\n5. Total perimeter = 56 + 70 - 14 (shared edge) = 112 cm\n\nCritical Flaw:\nThe student recognized the shared edge but only subtracted it once from the total perimeter (4+5 sides \u2192 9 sides \u2192 9\u00d714=126 \u2192 126-14=112). They failed to subtract the shared edge from both components simultaneously (3+4 sides). This shows they treated the shapes as independent perimeters with a simple overlap correction, rather than analyzing how each shape's contribution to the compound perimeter is reduced by their shared boundary.\n\nDistinction:\nThis differs from \"incorrect side length\" errors because the student correctly used 14 cm for both shapes. The core issue was miscalculating exposed edges due to improper overlap handling, not length determination.\n\nKey Misapplication:\nThe error stems from not internalizing that shared edges remove perimeter contributions from both shapes simultaneously, requiring subtraction of two side lengths (14\u00d72) rather than one.",
