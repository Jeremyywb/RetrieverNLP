  "explanation": "The correct area calculation would combine two length measurements (e.g., in millimeters) through addition and multiplication, producing squared units (mm\u00b2). The student selected km\u00b3 instead, suggesting they either:\n1. Mistook area (2D) for volume (3D), incorrectly cubing the unit\n2. Failed to recognize that area requires only two dimensions to multiply\n\nThe error stems from confusing dimensional exponents: squaring (for area) versus cubing (for volume). This directly corresponds to mixing exponents in unit conversion, not a failure to recognize length units. The misconception differs from \"multiplies all dimensions\" (which would still produce squared units if given two lengths) and specifically involves misapplying the exponent rather than misunderstanding unit types.",
