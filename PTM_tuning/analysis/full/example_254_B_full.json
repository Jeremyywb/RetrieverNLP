  "explanation": "The correct calculation groups all terms before division: \\(\\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}\\) or \\((0+1+3+4+7) \\div 5\\).  \nThe student computed \\(0+1+3+4+\\frac{7}{5}\\), as division occurs before addition in order of operations.  \nThe flaw stems from treating the division as only applying to the last term (7) rather than the entire sum.  \nThis occurs because the student failed to recognize that division must act on the grouped sum of all numbers, which requires parentheses.  \nThe error specifically reflects a misunderstanding of operator scope in order of operations, not merely performing addition first or misapplying operation priority.  \nDistinct from related misconceptions, the error isn't about strict BIDMAS hierarchy but about grouping to ensure division applies to the total sum.",
