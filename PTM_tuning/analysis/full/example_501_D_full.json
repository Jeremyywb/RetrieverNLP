  "explanation": "Correct comparison requires simplifying fractions: 8/12 = 2/3 (dividing numerator/denominator by 4). The student's 12/16 = 3/4 (dividing by 4). \n\nThe student compared 8/12 vs. 12/16 without simplification, treating them as distinct fractions. This shows they failed to recognize equivalent fractions through reduction. \n\nBy comparing 8/12 and 12/16 at face value rather than simplifying to 2/3 vs. 3/4, they incorrectly concluded these were equivalent to other diagrams. The misconception directly caused them to miss that 3/4 differs from 2/3. \n\nThis differs from common denominator errors (which focus on addition/comparison through scaling) and visual size misconceptions (which would involve misreading area proportions). The core issue is strictly about simplification, not alternative comparison methods.",
