  "explanation": "The correct sequence increases by consecutive integers: 1 (+2)\u21923 (+3)\u21926 (+4)\u219210. The nth term follows n(n+1)/2 (triangle numbers).\n\nThe student likely saw 1\u21923 (+2) and assumed constant addition, then possibly misapplied the square pattern. However, their answer (1,4,9,...) requires differences of 3,5,7,... which don't match the given 2,3,4,... differences.\n\nThe flaw stems from focusing only on initial terms (1 and 3) without verifying subsequent differences, then incorrectly associating the numerical values with squares. This matches \"only uses two terms\" as the primary misconception rather than visual pattern errors, since the numerical mismatch (3\u22604, 6\u22609) shows they didn\u2019t validate against later terms.\n\nThe error is distinct from not knowing square numbers (they correctly identified squares) or missing visual patterns (the question didn\u2019t require interpreting diagrams, only numerical patterns).",
