  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes \\( V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\) as a formula because it defines a mathematical relationship between variables (volume, radius, height) using an equality. The student incorrectly labeled it an \"expression,\" which lacks an equality and represents only a single value. \n\nThe error stems from focusing on the algebraic components (e.g., \\( \\pi r^2 h \\)) rather than the equality and its purpose. The student treated the entire statement as a standalone expression, ignoring the role of the equals sign in establishing a proportional relationship. This aligns with emphasizing form (the presence of variables and operations) over meaning (the equality's role in defining a formula). \n\nThis differs from confusing formulas with equations (since both formulas and equations use equality) or conflating expression terms (which would involve misinterpreting parts of the equation, not the entire structure). The error specifically reflects a failure to recognize the defining feature of a formula: an equality that models a relationship.",
