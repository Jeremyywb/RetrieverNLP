  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The circled digits are 8 (hundreds place) and 2 (tens place). Their actual values are 800 and 20. The product is \\(800 \\times 20 = 16,\\!000\\).\n\nStudent's error: They calculated \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) directly, treating the digits as ones-place values. This ignores the positional value of both numbers: the 8 represents 800 (third digit from right in 3847), and the 2 represents 20 (second digit from right in 28).\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student multiplied the face values of the digits without recognizing that their positions in the original numbers determine their magnitude. This demonstrates a failure to associate digit placement with quantity scaling (e.g., tens place = \u00d710, hundreds place = \u00d7100).\n\nDistinction: This differs from placeholder zero errors (which would involve misaligning partial products) or digit misplacement (which affects column addition). The error is purely about failing to compute the actual values represented by the digits in their respective places.\n\nThe misconception directly caused the student to omit two zeros from 800 (8\u00d7100) and one zero from 20 (2\u00d710), resulting in a product missing three zeros (100\u00d710=1,000 multiplier) that should have turned 16 into 16,000.",
