  "explanation": "The correct calculation rounds 9.1 m to 9 (nearest whole number) and 11.7 m to 12 (nearest whole number), giving 9\u00d712. \n\nThe student incorrectly rounded 9.1 m to 10 instead of 9, resulting in 10\u00d712. \n\nThe error stems from rounding 9.1 up to 10 despite it being closer to 9. This indicates a tendency to round numbers upward regardless of their decimal value, rather than adhering to standard rounding rules. \n\nThe misconception of rounding up rather than to the nearest whole number directly caused this error, as 9.1 was altered unnecessarily. \n\nThis differs from \"rounding to the wrong degree of accuracy\" because the student maintained single-digit rounding (e.g., 10 is still a 1-significant-figure number), but misapplied direction. \n\nThe error is distinct from \"rounding must change the number\" because 11.7\u219212 correctly changed the value, but 9.1\u219210 did not require a change.",
