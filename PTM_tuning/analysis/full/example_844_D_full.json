  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Rectangle perimeter: 2\u00d7(13 cm +5 cm) =36 cm\n- Triangle perimeter:4 cm +16 cm +16 cm =36 cm\n- Difference:36 cm \u221236 cm =0 cm\n\nStudent's error:\n- Likely added both perimeters:36 cm +36 cm =72 cm\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student correctly computed each shape's perimeter but misinterpreted \"difference\" as requiring summation rather than subtraction. This indicates a disconnect between understanding the arithmetic operation needed for comparison (subtraction) and the term \"difference,\" despite accurate perimeter calculations.\n\nDistinguishing from related errors:\nThis isn't confusion with area (values would differ significantly) or multiplication errors (operations were additive). The core issue lies in misapplying the definition of \"difference,\" not in perimeter calculation mechanics.\n\nConclusion:\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the question's comparative directive, not from flawed perimeter computation or area/perimeter confusion.",
