  "explanation": "The correct solution multiplies both sides by 3: \\(\\frac{5x-1}{3} \\times 3 = 2 \\times 3\\) \u2794 \\(5x-1=6\\). Tom's step is valid. \n\nKatie's incorrect step attempts to isolate \\(\\frac{5x}{3}\\) by adding \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) to both sides: \\(\\frac{5x}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\), but she erroneously calculates \\(2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\) as 3 instead of \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\). \n\nThe student likely rejected Tom's valid step because they misunderstood fraction operations, thinking multiplication must apply separately to terms in the numerator (e.g., requiring subtraction first). This aligns with the primary misconception of failing to recognize that multiplying both sides by 3 uniformly affects all terms. \n\nThey dismissed Katie's answer due to her arithmetic error, but incorrectly generalized this to invalidate both methods. This differs from related misconceptions about inverse operations or equivalent methods, as the core issue was misapplying multiplicative operations to grouped terms.",
