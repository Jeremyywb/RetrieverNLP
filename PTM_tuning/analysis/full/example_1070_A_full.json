  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Starting at -14, adding 3 four times:  \n-14 + 3 = -11 (1st)  \n-11 + 3 = -8 (2nd)  \n-8 + 3 = -5 (3rd)  \n-5 + 3 = -2 (4th)  \nTotal additions: 4, result: -2.\n\nStudent's error: Subtracted 3 four times:  \n-14 - 3 = -17 (1st)  \n-17 - 3 = -20 (2nd)  \n-20 - 3 = -23 (3rd)  \n-23 - 3 = -26 (4th).  \n\nThe student misinterpreted \"counting up in threes\" as requiring subtraction (term-to-term rule of -3) instead of addition (+3). This directly stems from reversing the direction of the sequence\u2019s progression. The error is distinct from general subtraction/confusion with negatives, as it specifically misapplies the term-to-term operation itself rather than misjudging number line movement or sign handling.",
