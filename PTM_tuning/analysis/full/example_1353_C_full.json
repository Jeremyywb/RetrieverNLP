  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(6^{9} \\div 6^{3} = 6^{9-3} = 6^{6}\\).  \nStudent's incorrect calculation: Likely computed \\( (6 \\div 6)^{9-3} = 1^{3}\\).  \n\nThe error stems from misapplying exponent division rules. The student treated the division as requiring both base division and exponent subtraction, even though the bases were identical. This caused them to erroneously reduce \\(6 \\div 6\\) to \\(1\\) while subtracting exponents, merging two distinct rules (same-base division vs. different-base division).  \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of dividing bases during exponent subtraction, even when bases are identical. It differs from \"dividing bases with different bases\" because here the bases were the same, and no actual division of distinct bases occurred. The error is specifically about mishandling the base retention rule for like bases.",
