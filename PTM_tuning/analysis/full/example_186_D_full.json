  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \"Fifty-six thousand\" = 56,000 (5 6 0 0 0); \"thirteen\" = 13. Combined as 56,000 + 13 = 56,013 \u2192 56013.\n\nStudent's error: Wrote 560013 (5 6 0 0 1 3). This places an extra zero between the thousands and the tens digit.\n\nReasoning flaw: The student correctly identified 56,000 but misinterpreted how to integrate \"thirteen.\" Instead of replacing the hundreds and tens places in 56,000 with 0 and 13 (\u219256_0_13), they appended 13 after three zeros (\u219256_000_13). This shows they treated \"thousand\" as requiring three literal zeros rather than understanding zeros as placeholders for empty value positions.\n\nMisconception link: The error stems from misapplying zeros as literal separators for \"thousand\" rather than using them to preserve place value. The student added redundant zeros instead of maintaining one zero in the hundreds place.\n\nDistinction: Unlike place-value column confusion (e.g., misaligning hundred thousands), this error specifically misuses zeros to \"reserve space\" for the \"thousand\" label rather than filling missing digit positions.",
