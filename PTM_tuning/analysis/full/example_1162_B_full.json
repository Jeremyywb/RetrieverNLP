  "explanation": "The correct approach shows \\( P \\div Q = Q \\div P \\) implies \\( P^2 = Q^2 \\), requiring \\( P = \\pm Q \\). Since \\( P \\neq Q \\), only \\( P = -Q \\) satisfies this. However, the student likely tested examples like \\( P = -1 \\), \\( Q = 1 \\), where \\( (-1) \\div 1 = 1 \\div (-1) \\), incorrectly concluding commutativity holds \"sometimes\". \n\nThis stems from misapplying division properties to cases where \\( P = -Q \\), not recognizing that such pairs are exceptions requiring specific sign relationships. The error reflects a belief that division can be commutative in isolated cases rather than understanding it universally fails for distinct numbers (unless restricted to negatives of each other, which the problem's answer implicitly excludes). \n\nUnlike generalizing from insufficient examples, this error specifically misapplies commutativity to special cases rather than broadly assuming it works for all numbers.",
