  "explanation": "To simplify \\(\\frac{1}{8}:\\frac{1}{2}\\), multiply both terms by 8 (LCD):  \n\\(8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = 1\\) and \\(8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 4\\), resulting in \\(1:4\\).  \n\nThe student likely multiplied both terms by 16 instead of 8, yielding \\(2:8\\) (\\(\\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 16 = 2\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 16 = 8\\)), then failed to simplify further.  \n\nThe error occurred because the student used a larger multiplier than necessary (16 instead of 8) and did not divide the resulting terms by their GCD (2). This reflects a failure to recognize that simplifying ratios requires both eliminating fractions and reducing integers to their smallest terms.  \n\nThe misconception differs from \"multiplies each side by different numbers,\" as the student multiplied by the same value (16). Instead, the flaw lies in stopping at \\(2:8\\) without completing the simplification step.",
