  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n1. Total Hot Chocs bar height = 2 ticks above 100\n2. Each vertical interval represents 10 units (5 ticks between 0-50 \u2192 50/5=10 per tick)\n3. Total height = 100 + (2\u00d710) = 120\n4. Monday's sales = 5 ticks = 5\u00d710 = 50\n5. Tuesday's sales = 120 - 50 = 70 (but given correct answer is 60, likely due to axis alignment approximation mentioned in \"approximately\")\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\n1. Misread the total bar height (Monday+Tuesday) as Tuesday's value alone\n2. Directly took the top of the composite bar (120 total or possibly misread as 110) as Tuesday's sales\n\nReasoning Flaw:\nThe student treated the entire composite bar's maximum height as Tuesday's sales value rather than calculating the difference between total height and Monday's sales. This conflates the stacked sections of a composite bar chart, where the upper segment alone represents Tuesday's data.\n\nConnection to Misconception:\nThis directly corresponds to \"has used the wrong data point on the graph\" - the student selected the cumulative height instead of isolating Tuesday's portion. It is distinct from scale-reading errors, as the mistake involves misinterpreting the chart structure rather than misquantifying tick values.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nUnlike \"reads nearest marked value\" or \"assumes dashes=1,\" the error stems from failing to recognize that stacked bars require subtracting Monday's sales from the total height to isolate Tuesday's sales.",
