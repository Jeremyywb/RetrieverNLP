  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The total (top circle) is 60%, which equals 0.6. The two parts must sum to this: 2/5 (0.4) + x = 0.6 \u2192 x = 0.2 = 2/10.\n\nStudent's error: They selected 100% as the missing value, likely reasoning: \"The problem involves percentages and fractions, so the total must be 100%. Since 60% is already given, the remaining part is 100% - 60% = 40%, but one part is already 2/5 (40%), so the other must be 100% to reach 100% total.\"\n\nFlaw: The student treated the entire model as representing 100% instead of recognizing the top circle (60%) is the whole. They forced the parts to sum to 100%, not 60%. This aligns with the misconception that part-whole models always represent 100% totals. \n\nDistinction: Unlike errors in fraction-percentage conversion (e.g., multiplying numerator/denominator), the student correctly converted 2/5 to 40% but misapplied the part-whole structure.",
