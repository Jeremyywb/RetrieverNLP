  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nGiven y = 3x and y = -1:\n-1 = 3x \u2192 x = (-1)/3 = -1/3 \u2248 -0.333...\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n-1 \u00f7 3 = -0.3 (exact decimal termination)\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student substituted an approximate decimal value (0.3) for the exact fraction 1/3 when performing division. This caused premature rounding before completing the calculation, truncating the repeating decimal after one place.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nWhile the student correctly applied division as the inverse operation, their error stems from improper substitution of fractional equivalents during computation. They treated 1/3 as terminating at 0.3 rather than recognizing its repeating nature.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThis differs from commutative errors (which would yield -3 through 3/-1) or operation reversal errors. The core issue is precise value substitution during inverse operations, not confusion about operation order or relationships.\n\nFinal justification:\nThe error specifically shows substitution inaccuracy within a correctly chosen inverse operation process, not a failure to select the inverse operation itself.",
