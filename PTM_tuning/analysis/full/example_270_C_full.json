  "explanation": "Correct solution:\n\\( x^2 < 16 \\) requires considering both roots when taking square roots:\n\\( |x| < 4 \\) \u2192 \\( -4 < x < 4 \\).\n\nStudent's error:\nSolved \\( x^2 < 16 \\) as \\( x < 4 \\), omitting \\( -4 < x \\).\n\nFlaw analysis:\nThe student treated \\( x^2 < 16 \\) as a linear inequality, only accounting for the positive root \\( x = 4 \\). They failed to recognize that quadratic inequalities require evaluating both directions of the squared term, specifically that \\( x^2 \\) can achieve values <16 from negative inputs (e.g., \\( x = -3 \\)) as well as positive ones.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThis directly stems from viewing quadratic relationships as exclusively positive-domain phenomena, ignoring the symmetric nature of \\( x^2 \\). The error matches the \"positive quadratic graph\" misconception rather than general inequality notation issues, as the student correctly interpreted \"<\" but misapplied it to a single boundary.\n\nDistinction:\nThis isn't a square-root-of-negatives error (student didn't attempt \\( x > -4 \\)), nor a single-value misconception (they produced an interval, albeit partial).",
