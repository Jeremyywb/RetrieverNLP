  "explanation": "The correct calculation sums all five values: \\( \\frac{0+0+2+6+9}{5} = \\frac{17}{5} \\).  \nThe student computed \\( \\frac{2+6+9}{3} \\), excluding the zeros from both the numerator and denominator.  \n\nThe error stems from treating the two zeros as irrelevant to the count, despite their presence in the dataset. The student likely reasoned that since zeros \"don't contribute\" to the total sum, they should also be excluded from the divisor. This conflates the role of zeros in the numerator (where they correctly do not affect the sum) with their necessity in the denominator (where they must be counted as valid data points).  \n\nThis matches the misconception of dividing by the number of non-zero values rather than the total number of data points. It is distinct from grouping errors or mode confusion, as the student explicitly excluded specific values (zeros) rather than miscounting categories or misidentifying the most frequent value.",
