  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Total cost = Entry fee + (Cost per ride \u00d7 Number of rides) = \u00a38 + (\u00a33 \u00d7 5) = \u00a323.\n\nStudent's error: \u00a33 \u00d7 5 = \u00a315 (no entry fee added).\n\nThe student calculated only the cost of rides (\u00a33\u00d75) but omitted the mandatory \u00a38 entry fee. This reflects a failure to recognize that the total cost requires combining two distinct components: a fixed initial charge and a variable ride-dependent cost. The error directly stems from executing only part of the multi-step calculation (ride costs) while ignoring the other (entry fee). \n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception of completing only one operation, not with \"different calculation\" errors, as the student correctly performed the ride cost calculation but neglected the required addition. Related misconceptions like \"does not complete all calculations\" are broader but less precise here, as the error specifically involves omitting a fixed initial value after correctly handling the variable component.",
