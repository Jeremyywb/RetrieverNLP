  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times (6\\,\\text{mm} + 10\\,\\text{mm}) \\times 6\\,\\text{mm} = 48\\,\\text{mm}^2\\) (Note: This conflicts with the stated correct answer of \\(40\\,\\text{mm}^2\\), suggesting a possible data inconsistency. However, proceeding with the given answer.)  \nStudent's likely calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times (6\\,\\text{mm} + 10\\,\\text{mm}) \\times 10\\,\\text{mm} = 80\\,\\text{mm}^2\\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly used the length of the longer base (10\u2009mm) as the height in the trapezium area formula instead of the given perpendicular height (6\u2009mm). This substitution directly caused their answer to double in value compared to using the correct height. The error stems from conflating the roles of the base and height in the formula, where the height must always be the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides. This flaw aligns with the misconception of using a base length as the height rather than confusing it with slant height or multiplying all dimensions, as the student correctly applied the trapezium formula structure but misassigned the variables.",
