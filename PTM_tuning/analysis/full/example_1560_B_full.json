  "explanation": "Perimeter requires length units. Correct analysis shows:\n- Valid units: km, m, cm (length)\n- Invalid unit: mg (mass)\n\nStudent's error:\nSelected km (valid length unit) instead of mg (invalid mass unit)\n\nReasoning flaw:\nMistook unit scale for unit type. The student incorrectly associated kilometer's large magnitude with being invalid for perimeter measurement, rather than recognizing:\n1. Any length unit (regardless of scale) is acceptable\n2. mg belongs to a different quantity type (mass)\n\nThis directly stems from confusing metric unit magnitudes with measurement categories. The error differs from volume/mass recognition issues because km was correctly identified as a metric unit but misjudged based on scale rather than type.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\n- Not about conversion errors (100m/km)\n- Not about non-metric units (miles)\n- Focused on conflating scale with validity rather than unit purpose",
