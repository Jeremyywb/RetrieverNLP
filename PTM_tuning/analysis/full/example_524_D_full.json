  "explanation": "The correct equation substitution requires \\( x + y = 20 \\). For \\( x=8 \\) and \\( y=12 \\), \\( 8 + 12 = 20 \\) holds true.\n\nThe student's answer \\( x=-8 \\), \\( y=12 \\) results in \\( -8 + 12 = 4 \\), which fails to satisfy the equation. The error stems from treating \\( x=-8 \\) as equivalent to \\( x=8 \\) in the sum, neglecting the effect of the negative sign on the total. This indicates the student incorrectly assumed the absolute value of \\( x \\) (8) could substitute for the signed value (-8) when summing, disregarding how negative terms alter addition. \n\nThis aligns with ignoring the negative sign's mathematical role rather than commutativity issues (which would involve term order) or variable constraints (e.g., assuming non-negative values). The error is localized to mishandling signed numbers in additive operations.",
