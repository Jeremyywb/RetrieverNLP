  "explanation": "The correct calculation adds the \"4x4 only\" and intersection values: 27 (only 4x4) + 15 (both 4x4 and Black Car) = 42 total 4x4 owners.  \nThe student likely stopped at the \"4x4 only\" value (27), excluding the intersection.  \nThis error stems from misinterpreting the Venn diagram's regions: the question asks for all 4x4 owners (full circle), but the student counted only the exclusive portion.  \nThe misconception reflects a failure to recognize that set totals in Venn diagrams require combining exclusive and overlapping regions.  \nThis differs from giving the intersect value itself (15) or mixing set labels, as the error specifically isolates the exclusive region instead of aggregating all relevant values.  \nThe missing 10 people outside both circles (60 - 27 -15 -8 = 10) are irrelevant here, ruling out total inclusion errors.",
