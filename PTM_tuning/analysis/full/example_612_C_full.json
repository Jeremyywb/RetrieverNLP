  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nTo solve \\( \\bigstar \\div 0.3 = 1.5 \\), multiply both sides by 0.3:\n\\( \\bigstar = 1.5 \\times 0.3 = 0.45 \\)\n\nStudent's error:\nInstead of multiplying, they calculated \\( 1.5 + 0.3 = 1.8 \\)\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student substituted addition for the required multiplication to isolate the variable. This stems from misapplying inverse operations - they treated division as if it required additive reversal rather than multiplicative inversion.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nWhile the primary listed misconception involves dividing instead of multiplying, this error demonstrates a broader operational confusion where an incorrect arithmetic operation (addition) replaced the necessary one (multiplication). It aligns most closely with the related \"subtracts instead of multiplying\" pattern but manifests as addition.\n\nDistinction:\nThis differs from dividing instead of multiplying (which would yield 1.5 \u00f7 0.3 = 5) or commutative division errors. The specific substitution of addition uniquely produces 1.8 through \\( 1.5 + 0.3 \\).",
