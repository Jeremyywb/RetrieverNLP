  "explanation": "The expression \\( 6 - 3g \\) consists of two terms: \\( 6 \\) and \\( -3g \\). A term is a single component of an algebraic expression, which can include coefficients, variables, and their products. The student incorrectly identified \\( 3g \\) as a \"variable,\" likely focusing solely on the presence of \\( g \\) and failing to recognize that \\( 3g \\) represents a product of a coefficient (3) and a variable (\\( g \\)), forming a single term. This confusion reflects a misunderstanding of how coefficients and variables combine to create terms, rather than an inability to distinguish expressions from variables or equations. The error is specific to mislabeling a term as a variable, not to misinterpreting multiplication syntax or equation structure.",
