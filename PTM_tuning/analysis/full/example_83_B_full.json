  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Identify first significant figure: 4 in 400099\n2. Next digit is 0 (less than 5)\n3. Round down, keeping 4 as first digit\n4. Replace remaining digits with zeros: 400000\n\nStudent's error:\n1. Correctly identified first significant figure as 4\n2. Incorrectly treated subsequent digits (00099) as a value \u2265500\n3. Added 1 to 4 (resulting in 5)\n4. Produced 500000\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student evaluated the entire trailing portion (00099) as exceeding 500 due to the trailing 9s, rather than only considering the immediate next digit (0). This caused them to erroneously round up the first digit. The misconception stems from misunderstanding that only the first digit following the significant figure determines rounding, not cumulative trailing values.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\n- Not confusion about the first non-zero digit (correctly identified 4)\n- Not rounding to nearest 100 (error magnitude exceeds that)\n- Focused on cumulative trailing digits instead of single next digit",
