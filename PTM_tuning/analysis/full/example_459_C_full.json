  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows Rachel at 7.5 km (from the graph at 12:30, which aligns with 12:15 as the distance remains constant between 12:00 and 12:30). Converting km to meters: \\(7.5 \\, \\text{km} \\times 1000 = 7500 \\, \\text{m}\\). \n\nThe student likely read the y-axis value as 7.5 km but incorrectly converted it to \\(750 \\, \\text{m}\\). This indicates they divided by 10 instead of multiplying by 1000, shifting the decimal one place left instead of three places right. \n\nThis specific error stems from misapplying the scale conversion factor (using 1 km = 100 m instead of 1000 m), directly aligning with moving the decimal too far left. It differs from reading \"10,000 as 1000\" or mm/m confusion, as the error is localized to decimal placement during unit conversion, not misreading labels or unit hierarchy.",
