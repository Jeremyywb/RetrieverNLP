  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires multiplying 3 by itself three times:  \n\\(3^3 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\).\n\nThe student interpreted \"3 cubed\" as repeating the numeral \"3\" three times, resulting in \"333\".  \n\nThe error stems from conflating exponent notation (repeated multiplication) with literal digit repetition. Instead of computing \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3\\), the student treated the exponent as a count for how many times to write the digit itself.  \n\nThis aligns with misunderstanding the operational meaning of exponents, where \"cubed\" signifies multiplicative repetition, not positional repetition of numerals. It differs from squaring errors (e.g., writing \"33\") because the student extended the flawed reasoning to a higher exponent, replicating the digit three times instead of two.  \n\nThe error is distinct from confusing squaring/cubing operations or misinterpreting \"value,\" as the core flaw lies in equating exponentiation with numeral duplication.",
