  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \nTo solve \\( \\bigstar \\div 0.3 = 1.5 \\), multiply both sides by 0.3:  \n\\( \\bigstar = 1.5 \\times 0.3 = 0.45 \\).\n\nStudent's error: \nThe student likely computed \\( 1.5 \\div 3 = 0.5 \\) instead of multiplying by 0.3. \n\nReasoning flaw: \nThe student applied division (the same operation in the equation) to isolate the variable, rather than using the inverse operation (multiplication). This caused them to incorrectly divide 1.5 by 3 (treating 0.3 as 3 due to decimal misplacement) instead of multiplying by 0.3.\n\nConnection to misconception: \nThe error stems from using division to \"undo\" division rather than applying multiplication, directly aligning with the inverse operation misconception. It differs from \"divides rather than multiplies\" (general operation choice) by specifically misapplying the inverse principle in equation-solving.\n\nDistinction from related errors: \nThis isn't commutativity (no reversal of operands) or general division preference, but a failure to recognize inverse operations in algebraic contexts.",
