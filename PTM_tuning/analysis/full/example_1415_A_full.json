  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires \\( \\frac{17}{40} \\times 100 = 42.5\\% \\).  \nThe student likely computed \\( 17 \\times 2 = 34 \\) and appended \"%\", resulting in \\( 34\\% \\).  \nThe error stems from treating the denominator as requiring multiplication by 2.5 (since \\( 40 \\times 2.5 = 100 \\)) but incorrectly applying this multiplier only to the numerator (doubling it instead of multiplying by 2.5).  \nThis matches the misconception of doubling the numerator to \"scale\" the fraction, rather than properly calculating \\(\\frac{\\text{numerator}}{\\text{denominator}} \\times 100\\).  \nIt differs from \"adding a % sign to the numerator\" (which would yield \\(17\\%\\)) or subtracting numerator/denominator (irrelevant here).  \nThe error specifically reflects an incorrect shortcut for scaling to 100, not a misunderstanding of percentages as parts per 100.",
