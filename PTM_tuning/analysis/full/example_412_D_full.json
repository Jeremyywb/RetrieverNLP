  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n- Probability of 0.9 indicates the event is expected to occur 90% of the time.\n- On the standard probability scale (0 to 1), values closer to 1 are described as \"likely.\"\n\nStudent's Incorrect Reasoning:\n- Interpreted 0.9 (a high probability) as \"impossible\" instead of \"likely.\"\n\nSpecific Flaw:\n- The student treated the probability scale as binary, equating any value less than 1 with impossibility. This ignores the continuous nature of probability, where 0.9 is explicitly distinct from 0.\n\nConnection to Misconception:\n- By conflating \"not absolutely certain\" (p = 1) with \"impossible\" (p = 0), the student misapplied boundary conditions, failing to recognize intermediate likelihoods.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\n- The error isn't about confusing complementary probabilities (e.g., calculating 1 - 0.9) or misranking likelihood terms (\"unlikely\" vs. \"likely\"), but specifically misidentifying the numerical threshold for impossibility.",
