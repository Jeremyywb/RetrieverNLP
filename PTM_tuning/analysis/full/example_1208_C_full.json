  "explanation": "The correct interpretation of a positive slope in a distance-time graph is that distance from home increases over time, indicating movement away from home. The student incorrectly concluded the positive slope represents movement toward home. Their reasoning likely inverted the relationship between slope direction and movement direction: they associated an upward trend in distance with approaching home rather than departing. This directly stems from misapplying the concept that increasing distance corresponds to moving away, not toward, the reference point (home). The error is distinct from confusing slope signs (e.g., labeling upward as negative) or misinterpreting rest periods (horizontal lines), as the student correctly identified the slope as positive but misattributed its meaning. The core flaw lies in reversing the causal link between slope direction and physical movement.",
