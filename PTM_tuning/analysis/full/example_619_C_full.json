  "explanation": "The correct approach identifies factors of 60 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60) to split 60 clients into equal classes. The student incorrectly selected \"multiples,\" which are values like 60, 120, 180, etc. \n\nThe error stems from confusing the operational purpose of factors (divisors that partition a quantity) with multiples (products that extend beyond it). The student likely associated \"splitting\" with repeated addition (multiples) rather than division into whole parts. This matches the primary misconception: treating multiplicative scaling as equivalent to equal division. \n\nThe error is distinct from HCF/LCM confusion, as the problem doesn\u2019t involve comparing two numbers. It also doesn\u2019t align with self-multiple rejection, since 60 is a valid multiple of itself but still irrelevant to partitioning. The mistake directly conflates the inverse operations of division (factors) and multiplication (multiples) in the context of grouping.",
