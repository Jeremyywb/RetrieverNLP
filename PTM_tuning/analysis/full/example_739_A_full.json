  "explanation": "The correct calculation combines like terms using exponents: \\(3 \\times l^3 \\times g^2 = 3g^2l^3\\).  \nThe student wrote \\(l3llgg\\), maintaining the original order of terms and repeating variables without exponents.  \n\nThe error stems from failing to recognize that algebraic convention requires grouping coefficients first and using exponents for repeated variables. The student preserved the literal sequence of multiplication (placing \\(l\\) before \\(3\\)) and listed \\(l\\), \\(g\\) repetitions instead of converting them to indices.  \n\nThis reflects a misunderstanding of how to structure simplified expressions: coefficients precede variables, and indices replace repeated multiplication. It specifically shows the student treated the expression as a literal string of symbols rather than applying algebraic simplification rules.  \n\nThis error aligns most closely with not using index form and misplacing the coefficient, rather than a broader failure to apply the commutative property (since the terms are rearranged but improperly ordered) or omitting multiplication symbols (which the student already avoided).",
