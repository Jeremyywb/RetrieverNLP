  "explanation": "The correct translation of \"p divided by q, then add 3\" is \\(\\frac{p}{q} + 3\\), where division precedes addition. The student wrote \\(pq + 3\\), treating the variables as multiplied rather than divided. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting \"divided by\" as adjacent variables (\\(pq\\)) instead of using division (\\(\\frac{p}{q}\\)). This occurred because the student conflated the algebraic convention for multiplication (adjacent variables) with the required division operation. \n\nThe flaw directly aligns with failing to recognize that adjacent variables represent multiplication, not division. This contrasts with the related misconception about order of operations (which would involve misplaced parentheses) or omitting multiplication symbols (which does not apply here, as the error involves operator choice, not symbol omission). The error specifically reflects a misinterpretation of algebraic notation rather than a general confusion about division vs. multiplication intent.",
