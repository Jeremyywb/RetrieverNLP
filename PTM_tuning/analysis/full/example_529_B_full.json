  "explanation": "To order fractions correctly, one must compare their values: \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.083 \\), \\( \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\), \\( \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \\). The student's answer \\( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{2}{6}, \\frac{1}{12} \\) lists these fractions in descending order. \n\nThe error arises from reversing the comparison direction: the student correctly identified the relative sizes of the fractions but ordered them largest-to-smallest instead of smallest-to-largest. This directly aligns with misinterpreting the problem's \"smallest to largest\" requirement as \"largest to smallest.\" \n\nDistinct from other misconceptions (e.g., focusing on denominators or shaded parts), the reversal of order indicates a failure to follow the specified sorting criterion rather than an inability to compare individual fractions.",
