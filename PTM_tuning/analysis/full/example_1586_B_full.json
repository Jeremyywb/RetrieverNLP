  "explanation": "**Correct Calculation:**  \nRecognize \\(9x^2 -24x +16\\) as a perfect square trinomial:  \n\\( (3x)^2 - 2(3x)(4) + 4^2 = (3x - 4)^2 \\).\n\n**Student's Error:**  \nThe student likely assumed \\(9x^2\\) directly maps to \\((9x)^2\\) in the binomial, leading to \\((9x -4)^2\\).  \n\n**Flawed Reasoning:**  \nThe student failed to take the square root of the coefficient \\(9\\) when determining the binomial's first term. They treated \\(9x^2\\) as \\((9x)^2\\) instead of \\((3x)^2\\), ignoring the need to reduce the coefficient to match the trinomial structure.\n\n**Misconception Link:**  \nThis stems from misunderstanding how to derive binomial terms from perfect square trinomials. The student prioritized preserving the original coefficient \\(9\\) rather than applying the square root operation required for factorization.\n\n**Distinction from Related Errors:**  \nUnlike errors in distribution or partial division, this specifically misapplies the perfect-square pattern by mishandling the leading term\u2019s coefficient. The student didn\u2019t adjust \\(9x^2\\) to its square root form \\(3x\\) before constructing the binomial.",
