  "explanation": "The correct answer identifies that a rhombus has four equal sides (its defining property), while a rectangle only does so if it's a square. The student rejected both answers, likely reasoning:\n\n1. They recognized Tom's answer was wrong (standard rectangles have unequal adjacent sides)\n2. However, they also dismissed Katie's answer, likely because they:\n   - Incorrectly required quadrilaterals with equal sides to also have right angles (overlooking that a rhombus only needs equal sides, not specific angles)\n   - Might have confused rhombuses with non-square rhombuses, not realizing squares are a subset of rhombuses\n\nThis shows they imposed an angle requirement where none existed in the problem's question, conflating properties of different quadrilaterals. The error stems from misunderstanding that side equality alone defines a rhombus, distinct from angle-based classifications like rectangles. This differs from related misconceptions about multiple valid names (the student didn't accept even one valid name) or total unfamiliarity with rhombus properties (they might know rhombuses exist but added extra requirements).",
