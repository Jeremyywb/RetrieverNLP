  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Convert 5 km to meters: \\(5 \\mathrm{~km} = 5000 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n2. Compute percentage: \\(\\frac{50}{5000} \\times 100 = 1\\%\\)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nDirectly computed \\(\\frac{50}{5} \\times 100 = 100\\%\\) without unit conversion.\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student treated the numerical values \\(50\\) and \\(5\\) as directly comparable quantities, ignoring both the units and the requirement to use the total (5 km) as the denominator. By failing to convert kilometers to meters, they incorrectly assumed \\(5 \\mathrm{~km}\\) was equivalent to \\(5 \\mathrm{~m}\\), making \\(50 \\mathrm{~m}\\) appear as 100% of the misidentified \"total.\"\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThis error stems from misidentifying which quantity represents the total in the percentage relationship. The student treated the part (\\(50 \\mathrm{~m}\\)) as the total by equating \\(5 \\mathrm{~km}\\) to \\(5 \\mathrm{~m}\\), bypassing proper unit analysis.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike unit-conversion misconceptions (e.g., thinking \\(1 \\mathrm{~km} = 100 \\mathrm{~m}\\)), this error specifically involves misapplying the percentage formula by swapping the part and total, regardless of units.",
