  "explanation": "The correct volume scale factor is calculated by cubing the length scale factor (15 cm \u00f7 5 cm = 3 \u2192 3\u00b3 = 27).  \nThe student likely calculated 3\u00b2 = 9 instead of 3\u00b3.  \nThis shows they confused the exponentiation required for volume (cubing) with that for area (squaring).  \nThe error stems from misapplying the principle that volume scaling depends on three dimensions, not two.  \nThis distinguishes it from surface-area or single-face errors, as the student correctly identified the linear scale factor but used the wrong power.  \nThe answer \u00d79 aligns exclusively with a 2D scaling misconception, not an arithmetic error in calculating the initial scale factor.",
