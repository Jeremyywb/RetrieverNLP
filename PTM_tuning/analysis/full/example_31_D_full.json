  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(450 \\div 100 = 4.5\\) (since \\(1 \\mathrm{~m} = 100 \\mathrm{~cm}\\))  \nStudent's calculation: \\(450 \\times 100 = 45000\\)  \n\nThe student inverted the relationship between centimeters and meters. They multiplied by 100 (as if converting meters to centimeters) instead of dividing to reduce the unit size. This reflects a misapplication of scale factors for unit conversion direction: they treated the target unit as smaller than the original unit, reversing the required operation.  \n\nThis directly aligns with the primary misconception of incorrectly applying multiplication/division for unit conversions, distinct from simply copying numbers or using division in other contexts. The error specifically stems from misunderstanding how numerical values scale when converting to larger vs. smaller units, not from arithmetic errors or unit-label oversights.",
