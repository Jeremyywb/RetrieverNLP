  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 8 \u00d7 2 = 16, then 16 \u2212 1 = 15.\n\nStudent's likely steps: 8 \u2212 2 = 6, then 6 \u2212 1 = 5.\n\nThe student incorrectly treated the \"\u00d72\" operation as \"\u22122\" rather than multiplication. This suggests they misapplied the first operation by confusing the multiplicative step with a subtractive one. The error directly stems from misinterpreting the mathematical operator, not from omitting a step or reversing the sequence. While they completed two operations, the flawed execution of the first operation (substituting subtraction for multiplication) caused the error. This differs from related misconceptions like skipping operations or changing order, as both steps were attempted but one was fundamentally misapplied.",
