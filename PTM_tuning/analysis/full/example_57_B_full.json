  "explanation": "To determine \\( p \\), the correct ratio is \\( \\tan(52^\\circ) = \\frac{6}{p} \\), as the problem involves the opposite side (6 cm) and the adjacent side (\\( p \\)). The student incorrectly used \\( \\cos(52^\\circ) = \\frac{p}{\\text{hypotenuse}} \\), which requires the hypotenuse. The error stems from conflating the roles of sides in the ratios: they recognized \\( p \\) as adjacent but incorrectly assumed cosine applies despite the absence of the hypotenuse. This directly aligns with misapplying SOHCAHTOA by prioritizing the adjacent side's presence over the need to pair it with the hypotenuse for cosine. The related misconception of confusing opposite/adjacent sides is ruled out, as the student correctly identified \\( p \\) as adjacent but misapplied the ratio.",
