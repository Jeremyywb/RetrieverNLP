  "explanation": "The correct answer requires recognizing that \"equilateral\" explicitly refers to equal side lengths (e.g., an equilateral triangle or square). The student incorrectly associated the term with the presence of a right angle. \n\nThe error arises from conflating two distinct properties: side equality and angle equality. The student likely assumed that shapes with standardized angles (like squares, which have right angles) inherently qualify as equilateral, without separating the condition for angles from the requirement for sides. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception that regular polygon properties (both sides and angles equal) are equivalent to \"equilateral.\" However, the student focused solely on angle uniformity (specifically right angles) rather than recognizing that equilateral shapes only mandate side equality, regardless of angles. \n\nThis explanation better fits the primary misconception than the related ones: the error isn't about misapplying rectangle properties (which require right angles but not equal sides) or misunderstanding angle measurements, but specifically merging angle equality with the definition of equilateral shapes.",
