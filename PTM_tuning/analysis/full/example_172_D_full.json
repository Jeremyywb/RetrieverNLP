  "explanation": "The correct first term is found by substituting n=1 into the formula:  \n5(1) - 7 = -2.\n\nThe student likely reasoned:  \n\"The first term corresponds to n=1, so the answer is 1.\"  \n\nThis shows they equated the term's position (n=1) directly to its value, skipping substitution into the formula. The flaw stems from conflating the term's positional index with its numerical value, assuming they are identical. This aligns with the misconception of treating the term number as its value rather than using it to calculate the term. It differs from arithmetic errors, as no calculation was attempted, and from other misconceptions like solving 5n-7=n, which would yield n=1.6 (not 1).",
