  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (9 \u00d7 5) - 1 = 45 - 1 = 44  \nStudent's likely steps: 9 \u00d7 (5 - 1) = 9 \u00d7 4 = 36  \n\nThe student incorrectly combined the two operations into a single modified multiplication. Instead of applying \u00d75 followed by -1 sequentially, they subtracted 1 from the multiplier first (treating \"\u00d75 then -1\" as equivalent to \u00d74). This shows a failure to recognize that operations in a function machine are applied in strict sequence to the result of the previous step.  \n\nThe error stems from collapsing distinct sequential operations into a merged calculation, altering the multiplier. This differs from merely reversing operation order (which would yield 40) or applying inverse operations. The misconception specifically involves misinterpreting how separate operations interact in a sequence, rather than general order-of-operations neglect or partial completion.",
