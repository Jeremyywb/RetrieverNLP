  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes a triangle with angles \\(90^\\circ, 45^\\circ, 45^\\circ\\) is both right-angled (due to the \\(90^\\circ\\) angle) and isosceles (since two angles are equal, implying two equal sides). The student correctly identified Statement 1 but failed to recognize that equal base angles (\\(45^\\circ\\)) necessitate two equal sides, making it isosceles. \n\nThe error occurs at the transition from angle equality to side equality: the student did not apply the property that equal angles correspond to equal opposite sides. This directly aligns with the misconception about isosceles triangle properties, as they recognized the right angle but disconnected angle equality from side equality. \n\nThis explanation distinguishes from \"sum of angles\" errors (the angles already sum to \\(180^\\circ\\)) or general misunderstanding of the question (they correctly addressed Statement 1). The flaw is specifically in misapplying the relationship between angles and sides in an isosceles triangle.",
