  "explanation": "The correct answer compares the ranges (20 for girls vs. 40 for boys) and recognizes that a smaller range indicates more consistent performance. The student incorrectly associated a larger range (40 for boys) with greater consistency. \n\nThe student's reasoning flaw stems from misinterpreting the relationship between range size and consistency. They equated a higher numerical value of the range with better consistency, reversing the actual inverse relationship (smaller range = more consistency). This directly corresponds to misunderstanding the directional link between the statistical measure (range) and the concept being measured (consistency). \n\nThe error is distinct from confusing \"most\" with \"least,\" as the student correctly identified the boys as having the larger range but assigned the wrong qualitative meaning to it. They did not merely swap labels but inverted the metric's interpretation.",
