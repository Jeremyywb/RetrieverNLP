  "explanation": "Correct perimeter calculation: \\( 2 \\times (5a + a) = 2 \\times 6a = 12a \\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\( 5a \\times a = 5a^2 \\).\n\nThe student multiplied the given dimensions (5a and a) instead of summing all sides. Perimeter requires adding each side's contribution twice (2 lengths + 2 widths), but they applied multiplicative reasoning appropriate for area calculations. This directly caused the substitution of multiplication for addition and the erroneous squared term. \n\nThe error is distinct from merely forgetting to double the sum (which would yield \\(6a\\)) or misusing the squared symbol with correct addition. The core flaw was interpreting perimeter as a multiplicative relationship between dimensions rather than an additive one, aligning with the primary misconception.",
