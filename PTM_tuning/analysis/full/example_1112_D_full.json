  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 120% of 50 = (120/100) \u00d7 50 = 1.2 \u00d7 50 = 60  \nStudent's error: Rejected calculation entirely, claiming percentages >100% are impossible  \nFlaw: The student incorrectly assumes percentages must represent fractions \u22641 (\u2264100%) of a whole, failing to recognize percentages quantify proportions relative to a base value (here, 50). This caused them to abandon calculation rather than convert 120% to 1.2 and multiply.  \nDistinction: This differs from misunderstanding percentage conversion (e.g., misapplying 120% as 0.12) or misreading digit placement. The error specifically stems from invalidating percentages >100% as mathematical impossibilities, not from operational errors in arithmetic.",
