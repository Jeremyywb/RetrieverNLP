  "explanation": "The correct solution requires expressing \\( \\frac{2}{7} \\times 3 \\) as \\( 3 \\div K \\times L \\). This simplifies to \\( \\frac{3L}{K} = \\frac{6}{7} \\), leading to \\( \\frac{L}{K} = \\frac{2}{7} \\), hence \\( L=2 \\), \\( K=7 \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly assigned \\( K=2 \\), \\( L=7 \\), treating \\( K \\) as the numerator and \\( L \\) as the denominator of \\( \\frac{2}{7} \\). This suggests they directly mapped the fraction's components to variables without recognizing that \\( \\frac{L}{K} = \\frac{2}{7} \\) requires preserving the ratio through reciprocal relationships in division.\n\nThe error stems from misidentifying which variable represents the numerator versus denominator in the division structure of \\( 3 \\div K \\times L \\). The student treated \\( K \\) as the numerator (2) and \\( L \\) as the denominator (7), reversing their roles in the required ratio.\n\nThis aligns with mixing numerator/denominator roles in division expressions, not with inversion rule errors (which would involve reciprocal operations) or fraction multiplication methods. The error is specific to variable mapping in a division context, not general fraction arithmetic rules.",
