  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\((6-2) \\times 180 = 720^{\\degree}\\)  \nStudent's calculation: \\(6 \\times 180 - 540 = 540^{\\degree}\\) (hypothetical flawed reasoning)  \n\nThe student likely subtracted \\(540^{\\degree}\\) from \\(6 \\times 180\\) instead of using \\((n-2)\\). This suggests they confused the total angle formula with an ad-hoc adjustment rather than systematic subtraction. Their misconception caused them to incorrectly reduce the total by three triangles' worth of degrees (\\(3 \\times 180\\)) instead of the required four.  \n\nThis error aligns with misapplying the formula as \\((n - k) \\times 180\\) for an incorrect \\(k\\), distinct from simply multiplying \\(n \\times 180\\) (which would yield \\(1080^{\\degree}\\)) or adding \\(2\\) to \\(n\\). The specific mismatch between the student\u2019s result and the correct pentagon sum (\\(540^{\\degree}\\)) further isolates the error to an incorrect subtraction value in the formula.",
