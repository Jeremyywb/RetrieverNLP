  "explanation": "The correct calculation substitutes \\(n=1\\) into \\(1-5n\\):  \n\\(1 - 5(1) = -4\\).  \n\nThe student likely treated the coefficient of \\(n\\) as the first term, calculating:  \n\\(-5 \\times 1 = -5\\).  \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the linear formula as representing a term-to-term additive rule (subtract 5) rather than an explicit formula for the \\(n\\)-th term. This caused the student to conflate the common difference (\\(-5\\)) with the first term itself.  \n\nThis aligns with confusing the sequence's explicit formula with its recursive structure, where the coefficient of \\(n\\) dictates the rate of change, not the initial term. It is distinct from calculating a 0th term (which would yield \\(1\\)) or misapplying direct proportionality.",
