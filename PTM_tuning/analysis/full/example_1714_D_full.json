  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{6}{9} \\div 3 = \\frac{6}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6}{27} = \\frac{2}{9}\\).\n\nStudent's error: \\(\\frac{6}{9} \\div 3 = \\frac{6 \\times 3}{9 \\times 3} = \\frac{18}{27} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nThe student incorrectly multiplied both numerator and denominator by 3 instead of multiplying the numerator by \\(1/3\\). This stems from misapplying division as scaling both terms equally, treating it as equivalent to multiplying numerator and denominator by the integer. \n\nThis matches the misconception of multiplying both terms by the integer rather than recognizing division requires multiplying by the reciprocal. It differs from dividing only the denominator (which would yield \\(\\frac{6}{3} = 2\\)) or other unrelated fraction errors. The error specifically reflects improper conversion of division into multiplication steps.",
