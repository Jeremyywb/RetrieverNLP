  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows \\( 9^4 = (3^2)^4 = 3^{2 \\times 4} = 3^8 \\). \nThe student likely interpreted Paul's \\( 3^2 \\times 3^2 \\) as equivalent to \\( (3^2)^4 \\), treating the multiplication as equivalent to exponentiation. \nThis conflates \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n} \\) with \\( a^m \\times a^n = a^{m + n} \\), leading them to incorrectly equate \\( 3^2 \\times 3^2 = 3^4 \\) to \\( 9^4 \\). \nThe error stems from misapplying exponent rules: specifically, failing to recognize that \\( 9^4 \\) requires raising \\( 3^2 \\) to the 4th power (yielding \\( 3^8 \\)), not multiplying \\( 3^2 \\) by itself once. \nThis differs from adding exponents during multiplication (a related misconception), as the mistake here is not arithmetic with exponents but misrepresenting exponentiation as repeated multiplication without proper power application. \nThe core flaw is treating \\( 9^4 \\) as \\( (3^2) \\times (3^2) \\) instead of \\( (3^2)^4 \\).",
