  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n72% = 72/100 = (72 \u00f7 4)/(100 \u00f7 4) = 18/25\n\nLikely student error:\nStudent wrote 72/100 but only simplified once: 72 \u00f7 2 = 36, 100 \u00f7 2 = 50 \u2192 36/50. When this wasn't an option, they selected \"None.\"\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student correctly initiated conversion to 72/100 and began simplifying, but stopped after dividing by 2 rather than recognizing 36/50 could be further simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 2 again. This demonstrates incomplete simplification rather than total inability to convert percentages or confusion about proper/improper fractions. The error directly aligns with failing to reduce fractions fully, not with more fundamental misunderstandings about fraction representation.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThis differs from not knowing percentages represent fractions (where students might write \"72\"), or improper fraction confusion (which would involve values \u22651). The partial simplification shows basic competency with factors, but insufficient follow-through.",
