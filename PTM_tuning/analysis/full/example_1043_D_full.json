  "explanation": "The correct comparison requires recognizing that among unit fractions, larger denominators yield smaller values: \\( \\frac{1}{5} > \\frac{1}{6} \\) (since 5 < 6) and \\( \\frac{1}{6} < \\frac{1}{3} \\) (since 6 > 3). \n\nThe student incorrectly ordered \\( \\frac{1}{5} < \\frac{1}{6} \\), treating the denominator as a direct indicator of size (i.e., assuming 6 > 5 implies \\( \\frac{1}{6} > \\frac{1}{5} \\)). This same reasoning caused the second error \\( \\frac{1}{6} > \\frac{1}{3} \\), again misapplying denominator size as a proxy for value. \n\nThe flaw stems from reversing the inverse relationship between denominator size and fraction magnitude. This directly aligns with the misconception that larger denominators produce larger unit fractions. \n\nThis explanation distinguishes from related errors like numerator-denominator differences or non-unit fraction comparisons, as the error is strictly tied to misinterpreting denominator magnitude in unit fractions.",
