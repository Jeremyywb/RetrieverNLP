  "explanation": "The correct simplification process: \n1. Recognize the fractional part \\( \\frac{7}{21} \\)\n2. Identify GCD(7,21)=7\n3. Divide numerator and denominator by 7: \\( \\frac{7\u00f77}{21\u00f77} = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n4. Combine with the whole number: \\( 3 \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\nStudent's error: The student focused on the numerator 7 being prime but failed to recognize that 21 is a multiple of 7. This caused them to incorrectly conclude the fraction cannot be simplified.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student assumed that a prime numerator automatically prevents simplification, without verifying whether the denominator shares that prime factor. This directly stems from the misconception that prime numerators cannot be simplified, even when the denominator explicitly contains that prime as a factor.\n\nDistinction from related errors: The error isn't about handling the whole number (3 remains unchanged) or general simplification skills (the process is correctly limited to the fraction). The mistake specifically involves misapplying the concept of primality to the numerator alone, ignoring its relationship to the denominator.",
