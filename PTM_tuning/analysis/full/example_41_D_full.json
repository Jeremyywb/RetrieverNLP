  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the arithmetic sequence formula: \\( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \\). Given \\( a_1 = 7 \\) and \\( a_4 = 25 \\), solving \\( 7 + 3d = 25 \\) yields \\( d = 6 \\). Thus, \\( a_8 = 7 + 7 \\times 6 = 49 \\).\n\nThe student likely computed \\( 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\), assuming the \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\)-term formula is \\( a_n = 7n \\). This bypasses the required common difference calculation and misinterprets the linear relationship as direct multiplication by the term number. \n\nThe flaw stems from conflating linear sequences with direct proportionality, incorrectly assuming the first term alone defines all terms through multiplication. This matches the primary misconception, as the error explicitly substitutes the correct formula (\\( a_1 + (n-1)d \\)) with \\( a_1 \\times n \\). \n\nIt differs from the related \"coefficient\" misconception (which would involve \\( 6n + 1 \\), for example) and the \"term after\" error (which would produce \\( 43 \\), not \\( 56 \\)). The student's approach exclusively relies on scaling the first term, ignoring the given \\( 4^{\\text{th}} \\)-term constraint entirely.",
