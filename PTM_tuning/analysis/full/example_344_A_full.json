  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(0.7 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{100 \\, \\text{cm}}{1 \\, \\text{m}}\\right)^3 = 0.7 \\times 1,000,000 = 700,000 \\, \\text{cm}^3\\)\n\nStudent's error: \\(0.7 \\times 100 = 70\\)\n\nThe student treated cubic meters as linear meters, multiplying by 100 instead of \\(100^3\\). This shows they applied the meter-to-centimeter length conversion factor directly to volume units without cubing it. \n\nThis matches the misconception of using the length scale factor (100) for volume conversions. The error differs from thinking \\(1 \\, \\text{m}^3 = 100,000 \\, \\text{cm}^3\\) (which would yield 70,000 here) or general metric confusion, as the calculation explicitly shows a failure to account for three-dimensional scaling.",
