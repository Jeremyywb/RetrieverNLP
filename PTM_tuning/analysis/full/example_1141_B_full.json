  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n0.5% = 0.5 \u00f7 100 = 0.005 = 5/1000 = 1/200\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n0.5% \u2192 0.5 \u00f7 10 = 0.05 = 5/100 = 1/20\n\nThe error occurred when converting the percentage to a decimal. The student divided by 10 instead of 100, incorrectly changing 0.5% to 0.05 rather than 0.005. This led them to convert 0.05 (which equals 1/20) instead of the correct 0.005 (which equals 1/200). The flaw stems from misunderstanding that percentages require division by 100, not 10, for conversion to decimals. \n\nThis specifically matches the division-by-10 misconception rather than decimal place value errors, as the calculation shows an incorrect divisor rather than incorrect decimal positioning. Other related misconceptions about significant figures or multiple-of-10 assumptions don't explain why the divisor changed from 100 to 10.",
