  "explanation": "The correct sequence follows \\( n^3 \\) for the \\( 3^{\\text{rd}} \\), \\( 4^{\\text{th}} \\), and \\( 5^{\\text{th}} \\) terms: \\( 3^3 = 27 \\), \\( 4^3 = 64 \\), \\( 5^3 = 125 \\). The student incorrectly associated these terms with triangular numbers, which follow \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). For example, the \\( 3^{\\text{rd}} \\), \\( 4^{\\text{th}} \\), and \\( 5^{\\text{th}} \\) triangular numbers are 6, 10, and 15, respectively, which do not match the given terms. The student likely misapplied the triangular number formula to the term positions (3, 4, 5) without verifying if the values fit, indicating a failure to recognize cubic relationships. This aligns with not knowing cube numbers rather than misidentifying a term-to-term rule (e.g., differences of 37 and 61 do not match triangular progression), as the error stems from a conceptual gap, not pattern extrapolation.",
