  "explanation": "The correct approach calculates LCM(18,15)=90, requiring 5 packets of rolls (5\u00d718) and 6 packets of hot dogs (6\u00d715). \n\nThe student likely calculated HCF(18,15)=3, reasoning that a shared factor would balance quantities. \n\nThis error stems from confusing conditions requiring equal division (HCF) with those requiring proportional scaling to match totals (LCM). The problem requires finding when multiples of 18 and 15 coincide (equal total count), not identifying shared divisors. \n\nThis directly aligns with selecting a factor instead of a multiple, not with misapplying division/multiplication operations or failing to recognize multiple situations altogether. \n\nThe HCF answer (3) fails practically, as it's impossible to buy 3 items from 15/18-count packets, confirming the need for LCM.",
