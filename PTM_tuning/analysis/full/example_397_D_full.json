  "explanation": "The correct calculation involves directly reading the y-value at x=12:00 from the plotted point (12:00, 5). The student likely misread the vertical axis scaling, interpreting each major grid line as representing 2.5\u00b0C instead of 5\u00b0C. For example, if the axis labels 0, 5, 10 were present, but the student assumed the first major line above 0 corresponded to 2.5\u00b0C rather than 5\u00b0C, they would incorrectly report 2.5\u00b0C instead of 5\u00b0C. This error stems from misinterpreting the axis scale, not confusing values with gradients or approximating to the nearest marked value (since 2.5\u00b0C isn\u2019t a labeled point). The specific flaw was assuming unlabeled grid lines represented smaller increments than they actually did, directly causing the miscalculation.",
