  "explanation": "The correct calculation converts the mixed number: \\(1 \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}\\). Adding \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) gives \\(\\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2\\).\n\nThe student likely added the whole number \\(1\\) directly to the numerators \\(2\\) and \\(1\\), resulting in \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\), and retained the denominator \\(3\\), yielding \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\). \n\nThis error stems from treating the whole number as a separate numerator rather than a multiplier of the denominator. The student failed to convert \\(1 \\frac{2}{3}\\) to \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) before adding \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), instead merging all integer values into the numerator. \n\nThis matches the primary misconception of adding the whole number to numerators without proper conversion. It differs from related errors (e.g., multiplying by numerator instead of denominator) because the student\u2019s operation shows no attempt to adjust denominators, only a direct sum of integers.",
