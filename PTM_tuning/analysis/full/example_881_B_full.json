  "explanation": "The correct nth term expression is derived by recognizing the constant difference of +2 between terms, leading to the linear formula \\( 2n + 1 \\). The student's answer \"Double, add 1\" suggests they identified the relationship between position number \\( n \\) and the term value (e.g., for \\( n=1 \\): \\( 2(1)+1=3 \\)) but misrepresented this positional relationship as a term-to-term operation. \n\nThe flaw lies in interpreting the positional rule (\"double \\( n \\), then add 1\") as a procedural description of the nth term instead of expressing it algebraically. This conflates the direct formula with a stepwise instruction, failing to distinguish between the term's dependence on \\( n \\) and operations applied sequentially to terms. \n\nThe error aligns with misapplying term-to-term reasoning to positional relationships, as the student treated the position-dependent rule as a verbal process rather than a function of \\( n \\). It differs from merely identifying a term-to-term difference (e.g., \"+2\") or deriving a rule from only two terms, as the student correctly linked all terms to their positions but miscommunicated the rule's form.",
