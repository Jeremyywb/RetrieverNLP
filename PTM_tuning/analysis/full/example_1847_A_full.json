  "explanation": "The correct calculations show inverse operations: Tom's subtraction \\(15 - 20 = -5\\) represents moving left 20 units from 15, while Katie's addition \\((-5) + 20 = 15\\) reverses this by moving right 20 units from -5. \n\nThe student incorrectly rejected Katie's valid equation. They likely interpreted addition as requiring the starting point to be zero, assuming \\((-5) + 20\\) would instead represent starting at 0 and adding -5 first. This misapplication of addition's properties caused them to view Katie's equation as invalid, despite it correctly modeling the number line movement from -5. \n\nThis flaw stems from misunderstanding how addition applies to negative numbers in non-commutative contexts, distinct from believing subtraction of larger numbers is impossible (which the student didn't exhibit, as they accepted Tom's subtraction). The error specifically reflects confusion about how addition operates from non-zero starting points, not a general rejection of negative addends.",
