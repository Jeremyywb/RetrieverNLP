  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires multiplying each age by its frequency to find total age sum (18\u00d77 + 19\u00d73 + 20\u00d71 + 21\u00d72), then dividing by total frequency (7+3+1+2). \n\nThe student's \"Age \u00f7 Frequency\" heading implies they computed values like 18\u00f77, 19\u00f73, etc., then likely summed these quotients. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying division where multiplication is required to calculate the total age contribution for each category. This reflects a misunderstanding of how frequency tables work: the student treated frequency as a divisor for individual ages rather than a multiplier to account for repeated values. \n\nThis directly matches the primary misconception of dividing instead of multiplying when calculating total frequency contributions. It differs from related errors like dividing total frequency by categories, as the flaw occurs at the per-row operation level, not in aggregating totals.",
