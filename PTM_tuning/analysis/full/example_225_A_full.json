  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \nGiven ratio 5:2, 5 parts = 70 cars \u2192 1 part = 14. \nTotal parts = 5+2=7 \u2192 7\u00d714=98 total vehicles.\n\nStudent's error: \nLikely added 70 (cars) directly to 2 (ratio's bike part): 70+2=72.\n\nFlaw: \nThe student treated the ratio's bike component (2) as an absolute quantity rather than a proportional part. They failed to scale the ratio's parts by the factor (14) derived from the given cars (70=5\u00d714). This shows they confused ratio components with actual counts instead of applying the scale factor to both terms.\n\nDistinction: \nThis isn't about misusing total parts (they correctly identified 5:2) or adding vs multiplying. The error stems from treating the ratio's \"2\" as literal bikes rather than scaled units.",
