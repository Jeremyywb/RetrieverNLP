  "explanation": "The correct estimation rounds each value to one significant figure: \n\\( \\frac{3 \\times 20}{0.2} = \\frac{60}{0.2} = 300 \\).\n\nThe student likely calculated:\n\\( 3.24 \\times 17.6 \\times 0.224 \\approx 10.8 \\).\n\nThe error stems from interpreting the division operation as multiplication. By multiplying all three numbers directly, the student treated the denominator \\( 0.224 \\) as a multiplier instead of a divisor. This aligns with misapplying the fraction bar's meaning, as the result \\( 3.24 \\times 17.6 \\times 0.224 \\) directly equals \\( 10.8 \\). \n\nThis flaw is distinct from rounding errors: even if unrounded values were used, the correct calculation requires division, not multiplication of all terms. The core issue is the misinterpretation of the division operator itself, not how values were approximated.",
