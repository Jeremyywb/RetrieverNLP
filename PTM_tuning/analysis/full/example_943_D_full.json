  "explanation": "The correct perpendicular slope to \\(2\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) (since \\(2 \\times -\\frac{1}{2} = -1\\)). The student incorrectly used \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as the slope. \n\nThey likely recognized the need for a reciprocal slope but omitted the negative sign. This shows a misunderstanding of the requirement that perpendicular slopes must multiply to \\(-1\\), not \\(1\\). \n\nThe error directly stems from neglecting the negative sign in the reciprocal relationship. This distinguishes it from related misconceptions like confusing gradients with intercepts or misinterpreting perpendicularity as parallelism, as the student correctly identified the reciprocal operation but failed to apply the necessary sign change.",
