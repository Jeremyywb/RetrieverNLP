  "explanation": "The correct algebraic representation for multiplying \\( m \\) by itself is \\( m^{2} \\), using exponent notation to denote repeated multiplication. \n\nThe student wrote \\( \\mathrm{mm} \\), interpreting the multiplication literally as two adjacent \\( m \\)'s without an exponent. This reflects a misunderstanding of how algebraic notation compresses repeated factors into exponents. \n\nThe error stems from treating the multiplication operator omission (e.g., \\( m \\times m \\rightarrow mm \\)) as sufficient, without recognizing that the operation inherently requires an exponent to denote the quantity of factors. \n\nThis misconception directly aligns with failing to connect repeated multiplication of identical variables to power notation. It differs from simply ignoring exponents or misunderstanding operator omission, as the student correctly omitted the operator but misapplied the notation for repeated terms.",
