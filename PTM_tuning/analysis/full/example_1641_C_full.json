  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows the mean (5+6+7+8+8+9+11+12+320)/9 \u2248 42.89 is skewed by 320, while the mode (8) occurs twice and matches other central values. The student incorrectly identified the mode as non-representative, despite it being 8 - a value near the median (8) and within the main cluster. This error stems from confusing which measure becomes distorted by extreme values. The student likely associated \"non-representative\" with the most frequent value rather than recognizing how outliers disproportionately affect the mean. This directly maps to confusing mean/mode terminology rather than misunderstanding mode multiplicity or calculation. Related misconceptions about single modes don't apply here, as the data indeed has one clear mode.",
