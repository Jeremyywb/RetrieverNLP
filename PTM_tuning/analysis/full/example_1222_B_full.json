  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 70.04 \\div 0.1 = 70.04 \\times 10 = 700.4 \\).  \nStudent's incorrect step: \\( 70.04 \\div 0.1 = 700.04 \\).  \n\nThe student shifted the whole number \"70\" to \"700\" (correctly multiplying by 10) but failed to apply the same place-value shift to the decimal portion. Dividing by 0.1 requires multiplying every digit by 10, moving each one left in place value. The \".04\" should become \".4\" (tenths to units), but the student retained \".04\" unchanged.  \n\nThis reflects a failure to recognize that dividing by 0.1 uniformly scales all digits by a factor of 10, not just the whole-number portion. The error is distinct from dividing by 10 (which reduces all digits) or misplacing the decimal during division algorithms. The student isolated the operation to the integer portion, neglecting the decimal's proportional scaling.",
