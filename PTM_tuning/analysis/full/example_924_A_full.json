  "explanation": "Correct Calculation: A hexagonal prism requires 2 congruent hexagonal bases (top/bottom) and 6 rectangular lateral faces connecting corresponding sides of the hexagons. The total is \\(2\\) hexagons + \\(6\\) rectangles.\n\nStudent's Error: The student selected \\(1\\) hexagon + \\(6\\) triangles, suggesting they used triangular faces and omitted one base.\n\nReasoning Flaw: The student likely conflated the structure of a prism with a pyramid. A pyramid has one polygonal base and triangular lateral faces converging at an apex. By using triangles and only one hexagon, they incorrectly modeled the lateral faces as triangles meeting at a single base (like a hexagonal pyramid) rather than rectangles bridging two bases.\n\nConnection to Misconception: This directly stems from misunderstanding prisms as requiring only one base and triangular lateral faces, a confusion between prisms (two bases, rectangular sides) and pyramids (one base, triangular sides). \n\nDistinction from Related Errors: While \"confusing triangular prism with pyramid\" is listed, this error specifically applies to hexagonal shapes. The mistake centers on misidentifying lateral face shapes and base count, not miscalculating edges or general visualization struggles.",
