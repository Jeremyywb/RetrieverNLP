  "explanation": "The correct fractions are 2/3 (\u22480.6667) and 8/30 (\u22480.2667). The student incorrectly compared 8 shaded parts (8/30) as larger than 2 shaded parts (2/3). \n\nThe error stems from directly comparing absolute counts of shaded parts (8 vs. 2) while ignoring the total partitions (30 vs. 3). This reflects a failure to recognize fractions as proportions, where both numerator and denominator determine value. \n\nThe misconception caused the student to treat fractions as whole numbers rather than relative quantities. This differs from not finding common denominators (which would require recognizing the need for proportional comparison) or misunderstanding equivalent fractions (which involves numerator/denominator scaling). The error specifically prioritizes visible counts over proportional relationships.",
