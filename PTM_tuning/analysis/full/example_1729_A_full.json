  "explanation": "The correct calculation combines the initial height (35 cm) and growth (7 cm) through addition: \\(35 + 7\\).  \nThe student incorrectly applied division: \\(35 \\div 7\\).  \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the relationship between the numbers as multiplicative rather than additive. The student likely fixated on 35 being a multiple of 7, assuming division was required to find a factor (\"how many times 7 fits into 35\") instead of recognizing the need to sum quantities.  \n\nThis aligns with confusion about when to use division vs. addition, distinct from subtraction errors (which would yield 28) or general misunderstanding of the question. The specific numerical relationship (35 divisible by 7) triggered the misapplied operation, not a failure to parse the problem\u2019s context.",
