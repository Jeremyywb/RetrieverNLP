  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 18 \\div 2 = 9 \\), then \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\), then \\( 9 + 4 = 13 \\).\n\nStudent's likely steps: Calculated \\( 2 + 2 \\times 2 = 6 \\) first (treating addition as equal to multiplication), then \\( 18 \\div 6 = 3 \\).\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student incorrectly prioritized addition over division, grouping \\( 2 + 2 \\times 2 \\) as a single unit. This violates the equal priority of division/multiplication over addition. \n\nConnection to misconception: The error stems from treating division and addition as having equal precedence rather than recognizing division must resolve first. This is distinct from left-to-right errors (which would yield 22) or calculation mistakes unrelated to grouping.\n\nDistinction: Unlike left-to-right execution errors, the student explicitly altered the operational hierarchy by combining terms not adjacent in the original expression.",
