  "explanation": "In a distance-time graph, the gradient represents speed. The positive sloping section shows distance from home increasing at a constant rate (linear rise), indicating steady movement away from home.\n\nThe student incorrectly associated the positive gradient with acceleration. This assumes the graph shows velocity (where a positive gradient would indicate acceleration), not distance (where gradient directly equals speed).\n\nThe error stems from conflating distance-time and velocity-time graph interpretations. A constant positive gradient in distance-time implies constant speed, not acceleration (which would require a changing gradient, i.e., a curve).\n\nThis directly matches the primary misconception of confusing graph types. Unlike related misconceptions about rest/movement confusion (which would involve misreading horizontal segments) or gradient-as-value errors, this specifically misattributes kinematic quantities across different graph frameworks.\n\nThe student's reasoning path: \"Positive slope \u2192 velocity increasing \u2192 acceleration\" incorrectly transfers velocity-time graph logic to a distance-time context, where slope magnitude already equals speed.",
