  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 2.5\\% = \\frac{2.5}{100} = 0.025 \\).  \nStudent's incorrect step: Directly equated \\( 2.5\\% \\) to \\( 2.5 \\), omitting division by 100.  \n\nThe student treated the percentage symbol as a standalone unit to remove rather than an operator requiring division by 100. This reflects a failure to recognize that percentages inherently represent parts per hundred.  \n\nBy conflating the numerical value with its percentage representation, they preserved the original number instead of scaling it. This aligns with the misconception that percentages are literal numerical labels rather than proportional values.  \n\nThis differs from dividing by 10 (which would yield \\( 0.25 \\)) or errors about adding symbols. The error specifically stems from disregarding the fundamental \"per 100\" relationship central to percentages.",
