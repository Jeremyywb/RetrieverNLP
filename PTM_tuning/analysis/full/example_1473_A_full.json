  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n1. Ratio green:red = 3:1 \u2192 total parts = 3+1 = 4\n2. Total squares = 16 \u2192 16 \u00f7 4 = 4 parts per unit ratio\n3. Green squares = 3 parts \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\n1. Took the ratio 3:1 as direct counts (3 green total, 1 red total)\n2. Ignored scaling factor \u2192 assumed 3 green squares suffice\n\nReasoning Flaw:\nThe student treated the ratio's \"3 green\" as an absolute count rather than a proportional relationship. They failed to recognize that the ratio defines parts of a whole, requiring multiplication by the scale factor (16 \u00f7 4 = 4) to distribute the 3:1 relationship across all 16 squares.\n\nMisconception Link:\nThis error stems from interpreting the ratio's given side as a fixed quantity instead of a relative measure. The student did not confuse the ratio's order (3:1 vs. 1:3) or miscalculate division/multiplication steps - they fundamentally misapplied the ratio's purpose to describe parts rather than totals.\n\nDistinction from Related Errors:\nUnlike mixing ratio sides (which would yield 4 green via 1:3) or division errors (e.g., 16 \u00f7 3), this error specifically demonstrates a failure to translate ratio parts to scaled quantities.",
