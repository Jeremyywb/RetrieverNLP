  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n0.8 (8 tenths) + 0.2 (2 tenths) = 1.0 (10 tenths = 1 whole)\n\nIncorrect process:\n8 (from 0.8) + 2 (from 0.2) = 10 \u2192 Student writes \"10\" in the tenths place as 0.10, then truncates to 0.1\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student treated the sum of tenths digits (10) as a standalone value to be placed in the tenths position, failing to recognize that 10 tenths equals 1 whole. This shows a misunderstanding of decimal place value relationships - specifically, that exceeding 9 in a decimal place requires regrouping to the next higher place value (ones column).\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike carrying errors (which involve misplaced additions), this error stems from not grasping how decimal quantities compose into whole numbers. The student didn't merely misplace a carried digit - they fundamentally failed to convert tenths to ones.",
