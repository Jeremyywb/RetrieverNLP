  "explanation": "The correct calculation reverses the operation: \n8 (output) - \u00bc = \\(7\\frac{3}{4}\\) (input).\n\nThe student likely calculated:\n8 \u00f7 4 = 2.\n\nThe error stems from treating division (by 4) as the inverse of adding \u00bc, rather than subtracting \u00bc. The student misapplied the inverse operation, substituting division for subtraction due to the fractional value's denominator. This aligns with confusing the inverse of addition as division (specifically dividing by the fraction's denominator) rather than subtraction. \n\nThis differs from \"not reversing the order of operations\" (which would involve adding instead of subtracting) or input/output confusion (which would preserve the operation but swap the values).",
