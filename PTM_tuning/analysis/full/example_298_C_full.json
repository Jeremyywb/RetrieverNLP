  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Coefficients multiply (\\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\)), exponents add (\\(p^{2} \\times p = p^{3}\\)), and variables combine (\\(q\\) remains): \\(10 p^{3} q\\).\n\nStudent's error: Calculated \\(5 + 2 = 7\\) instead of \\(5 \\times 2\\), while correctly handling exponents and variables (\\(p^{2} \\times p \\times q = p^{3} q\\)).\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student added coefficients during multiplication instead of multiplying them. This indicates they conflated the operation for combining coefficients (multiplication) with addition, despite correctly applying exponent rules for variables.\n\nDistinction: The error specifically involves coefficients, not variables. Related misconceptions about \"adding like terms\" don't apply here, as the student correctly multiplied \\(p^{2} \\times p\\). The flaw is isolated to misapplying addition where multiplication was required for numerical coefficients.",
