  "explanation": "The transformation \\( y = f(x-3) \\) replaces \\( x \\) with \\( x-3 \\), shifting the graph 3 units right, equivalent to the vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix}3 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\\). The student instead chose \\(\\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ -3\\end{bmatrix}\\), indicating a vertical shift. \n\nThe error occurs because the student interpreted the \"-3\" inside \\( f(x-3) \\) as a vertical operation. They incorrectly associated subtraction in the function's argument with a downward translation, rather than recognizing that horizontal transformations involve substitutions like \\( x \\mapsto x - 3 \\), which moves the graph right. \n\nThis directly stems from conflating the rules for vertical translations (e.g., \\( f(x) - 3 \\)) with horizontal ones. The student applied vertical-shift reasoning to a horizontal transformation, causing the mismatch. \n\nThe distinction from related misconceptions is clear: The error is not about confusing left/right directions or misapplying addition/subtraction within the horizontal context, but rather misclassifying the transformation's axis entirely.",
