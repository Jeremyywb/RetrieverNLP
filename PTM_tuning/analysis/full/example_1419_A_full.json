  "explanation": "The correct pattern follows 2n-1 squares for the nth term: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. The 7th term requires calculating 2(7)-1 = 13.\n\nThe student likely observed the first three terms (1, 3, 5) and incorrectly concluded that the term number equals the number of squares (1\u21921, 2\u21923, 3\u21925, then 7\u21927). This assumes a direct position-value correspondence rather than recognizing the arithmetic progression.\n\nThe flaw stems from equating the term's ordinal position (7th) with its quantitative value (7 squares), ignoring the established +2 incremental pattern. This matches the misconception of substituting position numbers instead of deriving from the sequence's rule.\n\nIt differs from related errors like misapplying differences (which would still yield 13 via 1+2\u00d76) or misidentifying visual features (the shape structure was correctly replicated but scaled incorrectly). The error is specifically numerical substitution, not pattern misanalysis.",
