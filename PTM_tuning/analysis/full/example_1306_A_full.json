  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nUsing the midpoint formula: \\(\\frac{7 + \\Delta}{2} = 0.5\\)\nMultiply both sides by 2: \\(7 + \\Delta = 1\\)\nSolve for \\(\\Delta\\): \\(\\Delta = 1 - 7 = -6\\)\n\nStudent's Likely Steps:\n1. Incorrectly set up the equation as \\(7 + \\Delta = 0.5\\) (omitting division by 2)\n2. Solved directly: \\(\\Delta = 0.5 - 7 = -6.5\\)\n3. Rounded \\(-6.5\\) to \\(-7\\) as the final answer\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nThe student treated the midpoint as a simple sum rather than an average, skipping the critical division-by-2 step in the midpoint formula. This caused them to solve \\(7 + \\Delta = 0.5\\) instead of \\(\\frac{7 + \\Delta}{2} = 0.5\\), leading to an unrounded \\(-6.5\\) that was truncated to \\(-7\\).\n\nConnection to Misconception:\nThis directly matches the misconception of believing the sum of coordinates equals the midpoint value rather than their average. The error stems from misapplying the midpoint formula\u2019s structure.\n\nDistinction:\nUnlike related misconceptions about distance calculations or endpoint reflections, this error specifically shows a failure to implement the midpoint formula\u2019s averaging step. The student\u2019s arithmetic followed logically from their flawed equation setup.",
