  "explanation": "The correct interpretation requires recognizing that a bar model's sections represent additive parts. Katie's model shows two equal parts (x + x = 2x). Tom's model has unequal parts (2 + x), which sums to \\(x + 2\\), not \\(2x\\). \n\nThe student likely treated the separate \"2\" and \"x\" sections in Tom's model as factors being multiplied (interpreting adjacent sections as multiplication), rather than quantities being added. This conflates the structure of bar models (where sections sum to the total) with algebraic notation (where adjacent symbols multiply). \n\nThe error stems from misapplying multiplication to sections that are actually additive, specifically assuming \"2\" and \"x\" in adjacent blocks imply \\(2 \\times x\\). This directly aligns with the misconception that a number and letter together in a bar model represent multiplication, rather than recognizing that multiplication arises from repeated variables (as in Katie's model). \n\nThis differs from the related misconception about \"section vs. whole\" confusion, as the error specifically involves misinterpreting the operator between sections, not misidentifying which part represents the total.",
