  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n232 \u00f7 5 = 46.4  \nRemainder conversion: 2 \u00f7 5 = 0.4\n\nStudent's error:\nInstead of dividing the remainder (2) by the divisor (5), they likely performed 5 \u00f7 20 = 0.25. This suggests they treated the remainder as \"divisor \u00f7 (remainder\u00d710)\" rather than \"remainder \u00f7 divisor.\"\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student misapplied decimal conversion by reversing the dividend and divisor relationship after the whole number quotient. They converted the remainder as if working with hundredths (25/100) instead of tenths, incorrectly scaling the division operation by a factor of 10 then dividing by 4.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThis differs from dividing denominator by numerator (which would yield 5\u00f72=2.5) or using divisor/10 (0.5). The error specifically stems from improper scaling and place value misunderstanding when transitioning from whole number division to decimal representation.\n\nThe misconception manifests as an inverted proportional relationship in the decimal conversion phase, not mere arithmetic errors or commutative confusion.",
