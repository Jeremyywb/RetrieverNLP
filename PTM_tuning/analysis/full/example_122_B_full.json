  "explanation": "To determine consistency, we compare variability measures. Girls have a smaller range (20 vs. 40), indicating less spread. The student incorrectly associated the boys' lower mean (60 vs. 75) with consistency. This error stems from conflating central tendency (mean) with spread (range). The student focused solely on average performance rather than variability, mistaking lower averages for greater uniformity. Unlike misconceptions about misinterpreting range values or comparing totals, this error specifically substitutes mean for spread as the consistency metric. The correct solution requires analyzing range, not mean, to assess consistency.",
