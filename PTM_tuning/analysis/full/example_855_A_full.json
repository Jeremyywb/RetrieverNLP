  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nNumerator: \\(5 \\times x^2 = 5x^2\\)\nDenominator: \\((x-3) \\times 2y = 2y(x-3)\\)\nResult: \\(\\frac{5x^2}{2y(x-3)}\\)\n\nStudent's error:\nNumerator: \\(5 \\times 2y = 10y\\) (multiplying first fraction's numerator with second fraction's denominator)\nDenominator: \\((x-3) \\times x^2 = x^2(x-3)\\) (multiplying first fraction's denominator with second fraction's numerator)\n\nExplanation:\nThe student incorrectly multiplied terms diagonally across the two fractions instead of multiplying numerators and denominators separately. This reflects a misapplication of cross-multiplication (typically used for division of fractions) to a multiplication problem. They treated the operation as \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{a \\times d}{b \\times c}\\) instead of \\(\\frac{a \\times c}{b \\times d}\\). This specific error distinguishes it from general denominator multiplication errors, as the flawed process involved term-pairing between different fractions' components.",
