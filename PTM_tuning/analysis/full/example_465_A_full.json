  "explanation": "To verify quadratic nature, calculate second differences:\nFor Tom's sequence:\nFirst differences: 5-3=2, 10-5=5, 17-10=7, 26-17=9\nSecond differences: 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 9-7=2 \u2192 not constant (3,2,2)\n\nFor Katie's sequence:\nFirst differences: 3,6,12,24 \u2192 geometric progression (\u00d72 each time)\n\nThe student likely:\n1) Calculated only first differences for Tom's sequence (2,5,7,9)\n2) Mistakenly assumed these follow n\u00b2 progression (1,4,9,16,25) when offset by +1\n3) Failed to compute actual second differences that disprove quadratic structure\n\nThis stems from only comparing sequence terms to memorized quadratic examples rather than systematically checking second differences. While related misconceptions involve insufficient term checks, this specific error shows a misapplication of quadratic identification criteria even when multiple terms were available.\n\nThe distinction: The student correctly rejected Katie's geometric sequence but erred in accepting Tom's due to superficial pattern matching rather than rigorous difference analysis.",
