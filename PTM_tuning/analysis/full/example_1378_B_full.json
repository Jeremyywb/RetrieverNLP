  "explanation": "The correct answer uses the inequality \\( j < 5 \\) to show that \\( j \\) is smaller than 5.  \nThe student wrote \\( j = 5 \\), which equates \\( j \\) to 5 rather than comparing magnitudes.  \n\nThe error stems from interpreting the question as requiring a statement about equivalence (\"equals\") instead of a magnitude comparison (\"less than\").  \nThis directly reflects a confusion between equations (which assert equality) and inequalities (which assert relationships between quantities), as the student substituted an equation where an inequality was needed.  \n\nThis differs from a general misunderstanding of inequality notation, as the error specifically involves replacing a comparison operator with an equality operator rather than misapplying inequality symbols (e.g., reversing \\(<\\) and \\(>\\)).  \nThe student recognized the need to reference 5 but misidentified the required mathematical relationship.",
