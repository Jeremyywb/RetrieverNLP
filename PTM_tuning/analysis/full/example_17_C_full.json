  "explanation": "Correct algebraic proof:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\n(2n-1) + (2m+1) \\\\\n= 2n - 1 + 2m + 1 \\\\\n= 2n + 2m \\\\\n= 2(n + m)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nStudent's answer lacks algebraic representation and justification:\n\\[\n\\text{Odd + Odd} = \\text{even}\n\\]\nThe student failed to express odd numbers in general form (\\(2k \\pm 1\\)) and perform the critical step of combining like terms (\\(-1 + 1 = 0\\)). This omission prevents the demonstration of how the sum becomes a multiple of 2. The error stems from bypassing algebraic justification required for proofs, reducing the argument to an unsubstantiated claim. This aligns with skipping algebraic steps rather than numerical example reliance or notation confusion, as no specific numbers or symbolic misuse occurred.",
