  "explanation": "The correct denominator is calculated using combinations: total ways to choose 3 balls from 9 is \\(\\binom{9}{3} = 84\\), or permutations \\(9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 504\\) if order matters. The student likely used the total number of balls (9) instead of accounting for all possible groups of 3. \n\nThe error stems from treating the problem as a single selection (with 9 outcomes) rather than recognizing that selecting three balls requires counting all distinct groups or sequences. This aligns with failing to consider all possible outcomes in multi-step selections. \n\nThe misconception differs from adding denominators (which applies to fractions) or replacement errors, as the student\u2019s answer reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how to quantify total outcomes in a multi-choice scenario.",
