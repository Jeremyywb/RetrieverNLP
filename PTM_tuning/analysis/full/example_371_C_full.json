  "explanation": "Correct rotation of point A(1,3) 90\u00b0 clockwise around (3,2):\n- Apply rotation formula: new_x = center_x + (original_y - center_y) = 3 + (3-2) = 4  \nnew_y = center_y - (original_x - center_x) = 2 - (1-3) = 4  \nExpected result: (4,4). Actual transformed point shown: (4,3).  \n\nStudent likely calculated direction reversal:\n- If rotating (1,3) 90\u00b0 anticlockwise around (3,2):  \nnew_x = 3 - (3-2) = 2  \nnew_y = 2 + (1-3) = 0 \u2192 (2,0) \u2260 (4,3).  \n\nThe flaw: Student assumed direction alone caused mismatch, without verifying center's role. The actual error (wrong center) shifts all coordinates systemically, which direction reversal cannot fix. The student conflated visual position differences with rotation direction, failing to isolate the center's geometric impact. This distinguishes from \"applies incorrect rotation rule\" because direction reversal still produces coordinates inconsistent with the transformed rectangle when applied to the correct center.",
