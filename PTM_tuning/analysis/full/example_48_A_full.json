  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \nGiven output = 3(input - 3) = 9a - 21  \nReverse steps:  \n1. Divide by 3: (9a - 21)/3 = 3a - 7  \n2. Add 3: 3a - 7 + 3 = 3a - 4  \n\nStudent's likely steps:  \n1. Divided 9a - 21 by 3: (9a - 21)/3 = 3a - 7  \n2. Subtracted 3 instead of adding: 3a - 7 - 3 = 3a - 10 (\u2260 3a - 18)  \n\nFlaw: The student reversed the order of inverse operations but misapplied the additive inverse. While they correctly divided first, they subtracted 3 (mirroring the original subtraction) instead of adding to undo it. This aligns with misunderstanding how consecutive inverse operations must fully reverse each step.  \n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:  \nThis error specifically stems from mishandling inverse operations (subtracting instead of adding after division), not from confusing input/output order or misapplying algebraic properties like commutativity.  \n\n(Note: The student\u2019s answer 3a - 18 doesn\u2019t perfectly align with the shown steps. A plausible alternate path: They may have directly subtracted 3 before dividing, i.e., (9a - 21 - 3)/3 = (9a - 24)/3 = 3a - 8, but this still doesn\u2019t match 3a - 18. The exact calculation path to 3a - 18 remains unclear, but the core flaw remains misapplying inverse operations.)",
