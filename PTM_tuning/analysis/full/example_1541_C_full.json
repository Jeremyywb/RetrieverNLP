  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires a discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac = 0 \\), leading to \\( \\frac{-3}{5} \\) as the single solution. The student incorrectly computed \\( \\sqrt{-16} \\), implying a discriminant of \\( -16 \\). Their reasoning flaw was equating \"exactly one solution\" with needing to eliminate the \\( \\pm \\) term entirely, rather than recognizing that \\( \\sqrt{0} \\) collapses the two potential solutions into one. This stems from conflating \"no real solutions\" (from negative discriminant) with \"one solution\" (from zero discriminant). They likely dismissed the correct answer due to misinterpreting \\( \\sqrt{0} \\) as invalid or non-simplifying, then selected the negative discriminant case by error. This directly aligns with misunderstanding discriminant interpretation rather than arithmetic errors with negatives or square root validity.",
