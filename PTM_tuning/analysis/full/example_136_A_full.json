  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n-4 \u00d7 6 = -24 (one negative and one positive number)\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\n-3 \u00d7 -8 = +24 (two negative numbers)\n\nThe student selected two negative numbers, incorrectly assuming this would produce a negative product. Their reasoning likely concluded that since the target product (-24) is negative, both factors must inherently carry negative signs. However, multiplying two negatives yields a positive result, making their answer mathematically impossible. This directly stems from misapplying the relationship between operand signs and product signs, specifically confusing the requirement for a single negative operand to produce a negative product.\n\nThis error differs from thinking two positives could yield a negative (which would require sign errors in calculation) or ignoring negative signs entirely (which would produce magnitude mismatches). The student recognized the need for negative components but incorrectly doubled them rather than balancing with a positive operand.",
