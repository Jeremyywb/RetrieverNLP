  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n1. \u00a3150 \u00d7 1.60 = \u00a3240 (after 60% increase)\n2. \u00a3240 \u00d7 1.10 = \u00a3264 (after 10% increase)\n3. Final amount as percentage of original: (264/150) \u00d7 100 = 176%\n\nStudent's error: \nCalculated \u00a3264 but incorrectly interpreted this as 264% directly, skipping step 3.\n\nFlaw explanation: \nThe student treated the final numerical value (\u00a3264) as the percentage itself, rather than computing the ratio relative to the original (\u00a3150). This reflects a failure to recognize that percentages must be calculated proportionally to the original base value. \n\nDistinguishing from related misconceptions: \nUnlike errors involving additive percentage sums or misapplying changes to the original base, this mistake occurred after correctly computing the final amount. The core issue was misinterpreting the absolute value as a percentage rather than performing the required proportional calculation.",
