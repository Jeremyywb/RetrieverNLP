  "explanation": "The correct calculation divides the total shaded amount (4/5) by 4 equal parts: \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\div 4 = \\frac{1}{5} \\).  \nThe student likely reversed the relationship, dividing the total parts (5) by the number of shaded segments (4): \\( 5 \\div 4 = \\frac{5}{4} \\).  \nThis error stems from misidentifying the \"whole\" as the shaded portion (4 parts) rather than the entire bar (5 parts).  \nThe student treated the shaded segments as the denominator (4) and the total segments as the numerator (5), inverting the fraction's structure.  \nThis aligns with part-whole confusion rather than errors like miscounting total parts or mislabeling denominators.  \nThe mistake specifically substitutes the total quantity for the part being measured, distinct from general denominator misuse.",
