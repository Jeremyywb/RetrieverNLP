  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Area of trapezoid = ((15 + 24)/2) \u00d7 (10 - 8) = 39 m  \nStudent's likely calculation: 24 \u00d7 5 = 120 m  \n\nThe student incorrectly used the maximum speed (24 m/s) multiplied by an unrelated 5-second interval instead of averaging the initial and final speeds over the actual 2-second period. This indicates they isolated the final speed value and applied it to an assumed duration unrelated to the problem's specified interval (8-10 seconds).  \n\nThe error directly stems from treating the problem as requiring simple maximum-speed \u00d7 total-time multiplication, ignoring both the trapezoidal area requirement and the specific time window. This aligns with the misconception of using maximum speed without averaging for trapezoids but introduces an unexplained 5-second duration (possibly from misreading or prior graph sections).  \n\nIt differs from \"not dividing by 2 for triangles\" or \"using line length\" errors, as the magnitude and structure of 120 m specifically reflect misapplied speed-time multiplication rather than geometric misinterpretations.",
