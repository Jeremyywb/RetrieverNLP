  "explanation": "Correct calculation: When \\( r = 3 \\), \\( f = 3(3)^2 + 3 = 3(9) + 3 = 27 + 3 = 30 \\).\n\nIncorrect approach: The student likely calculated \\( f \\) for \\( r = 3 \\) by extending the sequence \\( 6, 15, \\ldots \\) linearly. They observed \\( 15 - 6 = 9 \\), assumed the pattern adds 9 each time, and computed \\( 15 + 9 = 24 \\).\n\nThe error stems from treating the output values as a linear sequence rather than applying the quadratic formula. The student focused on differences between consecutive terms instead of recognizing the explicit \\( r^2 \\) relationship. This matches the misconception of deriving a term-to-term rule from two terms while ignoring the given equation.\n\nThis explanation better fits the error than the \"mixing squaring/doubling\" misconception, as there's no evidence the student attempted to compute \\( 3r^2 \\) at all. The error is purely about pattern extension, not algebraic misapplication.",
