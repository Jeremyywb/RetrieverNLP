  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Ratio parts: 3 green + 1 red = 4 total parts\n- Total squares: 16\n- Value per part: 16 \u00f7 4 = 4\n- Green squares: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nStudent's error:\n- Incorrect operation: 16 \u00f7 (3 - 1) = 8\n\nFlawed reasoning:\nThe student subtracted ratio components (3 - 1 = 2) rather than summing them. By dividing the total squares by this difference instead of the total parts, they incorrectly derived 8 green squares. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of ratio composition, where the sum of parts determines unit size. The error specifically stems from treating the ratio's contrast as its structural basis rather than its combined quantity.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThis differs from simply swapping ratio terms (which would yield 4 green) or dividing by individual ratio components (which would produce non-integer results). The error uniquely prioritizes the disparity between ratio terms over their collective relationship.",
