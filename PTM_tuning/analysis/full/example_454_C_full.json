  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nOutput = (input - 1) \u00d7 2 = 8  \nReverse steps using inverse operations:  \n8 \u00f7 2 = 4  \n4 + 1 = 5  \n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:  \n8 + 1 = 9  \n9 \u00d7 2 = 18 (but student wrote 14)  \n*Alternatively, possible miscalculation:*  \n8 \u00d7 2 = 16  \n16 - 2 = 14  \n\nFlawed reasoning:  \nThe student reversed the sequence of operations (applying \"\u22121\" first instead of last) but incorrectly used the original operations rather than their inverses. For example, they may have computed 8 \u00d7 2 = 16 followed by 16 - 2 = 14, treating subtraction as the inverse of multiplication instead of division. This reflects a failure to recognize that reversing operations requires both order reversal and proper inverse operations (division for multiplication, addition for subtraction).  \n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis differs from simply reversing operations with correct inverses (which would yield 15) or confusing inverse operations like using addition for division. The error specifically combines order reversal with incorrect inverse operations.",
