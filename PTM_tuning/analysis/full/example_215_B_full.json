  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nTotal span: 4 - (-8) = 12 units across 6 intervals (7 dashes). Each interval = 12/6 = 2. B is 2 intervals below 4: 4 - (2\u00d72) = 0.\n\nStudent's error:\nLikely calculated 4 - 2 = 2 (treating each dash as 1 unit).\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student assumed dashes represent single-unit increments rather than calculating the actual interval size (2 units). This caused them to subtract 2 units directly from 4 instead of subtracting 4 units (2 dashes \u00d7 2 units/dash). This matches the misconception of assuming every dash equals +1.\n\nDistinction:\nThis isn't a miscount of dashes (they correctly identified 2 below 4) or a middle-value error, but specifically a unit-scale misinterpretation. The error stems from assuming a dash-to-unit correspondence without verifying the interval size.",
