  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows \\(\\frac{a+b}{c}\\) and \\((a+b) \\div c\\) both enforce addition before division through parentheses/fraction grouping, making them equivalent. The student incorrectly concluded \"Need more information,\" likely reasoning that the division symbol \"\u00f7\" might alter the operation order despite the explicit parentheses. This reflects a failure to recognize that parentheses in \\((a+b) \\div c\\) and the fraction bar in \\(\\frac{a+b}{c}\\) serve identical grouping purposes. The misconception stems from undervaluing structural equivalence in algebraic notation, not from miscalculating operation order. This differs from related errors like ignoring brackets entirely (where parentheses would be disregarded) or misunderstanding term division mechanics (which would involve incorrect term manipulation). The error specifically arises from doubting equivalence without additional context despite identical grouping structures.",
