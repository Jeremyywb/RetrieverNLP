  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 384 \\div 3 = 128 \\). This is derived by dividing the product (384) by the known factor (3).\n\nStudent's likely calculation: The student appears to have either guessed 161 without systematic calculation or used an incorrect operation. For example, \\( 3 \\times 161 = 483 \\), which exceeds 384, indicating no valid division or inverse operation was applied.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student failed to recognize that division is the inverse operation required to isolate the missing factor in a multiplication equation. Instead of computing \\( 384 \\div 3 \\), they selected a number unrelated to the division process.\n\nMisconception link: This error directly stems from not understanding that division reverses multiplication in such equations. The student treated the problem as requiring trial-and-error guessing rather than systematic division.\n\nDistinction from related errors: The answer isn't a result of subtraction (which would yield lower values) or place-value carry errors, as no intermediate steps align with those patterns. The error reflects a complete absence of division strategy rather than a flawed execution of it.",
