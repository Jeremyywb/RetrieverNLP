  "explanation": "The correct understanding recognizes that arrows on sides in a parallelogram specifically denote parallelism. The student's answer \"opposite\" indicates they correctly identified QR and PS as opposing sides but misattributed the arrow notation's purpose. The error stems from interpreting the arrows as marking positional opposition rather than parallel relationships. This directly aligns with confusing notation for side position with notation for parallelism, as the arrows were not recognized as the standard symbol for parallel sides. It differs from not knowing parallelogram properties entirely, as the student correctly located opposite sides but failed to connect the notation to their inherent parallelism. The misconception specifically caused substitution of \"opposite\" for the required geometric relationship the arrows actually represent.",
