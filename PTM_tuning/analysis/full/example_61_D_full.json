  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \\), \\( \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \\). Midpoint: \\( \\frac{0.5 + 0.75}{2} = \\frac{1.25}{2} = 0.625 = \\frac{5}{8} \\).\n\nLikely student error: The student may have incorrectly calculated \\( \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5}{4} \\) without dividing by 2 for the midpoint, arriving at \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\). Since this value exceeds the given number line range (which ends at \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\)), they concluded \"None of these.\"\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the midpoint as a sum rather than an average. This directly stems from misapplying the midpoint formula, confusing additive combination with averaging. \n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike equivalent fraction errors (which would involve misinterpreting \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) as \\( \\frac{2.5}{4} \\)), this error specifically omits the critical division-by-2 step required for midpoints. The student recognized the need to combine values but failed to apply the midpoint operation correctly.",
