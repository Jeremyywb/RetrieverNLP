  "explanation": "The correct simplification requires factoring the numerator: \\( t^2 - 1 = (t+1)(t-1) \\). The student likely stopped at \\( \\frac{t^2 - 1}{t+1} \\) without recognizing that \\( t^2 - 1 \\) could be factored. This indicates they failed to identify the numerator as a difference of squares, which prevents seeing \\( t+1 \\) as a common factor. The error stems from an inability to decompose quadratic expressions into factors, specifically missing the relationship \\( t^2 - a^2 = (t+a)(t-a) \\). Unlike cancellation errors (e.g., incorrectly removing non-factors), this mistake shows no attempt to factor at all. The answer \"does not simplify\" directly aligns with this lack of recognition rather than flawed cancellation steps.",
