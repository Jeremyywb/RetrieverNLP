  "explanation": "The correct calculation evaluates \\( 9^0 \\) which equals 1 through the zero-exponent rule \\( a^0 = 1 \\) for \\( a \\neq 0 \\). \n\nThe student likely computed \\( 9^0 \\) as \\( 9 \\times 0 \\), incorrectly interpreting the exponent as a multiplier. However, this would yield 0, not 9. Instead, their error stems from misapplying the concept of exponentiation entirely. They treated the exponent \\( 0 \\) as irrelevant, retaining the base value unchanged (e.g., \\( 9^0 = 9 \\)), demonstrating a failure to recognize that exponents modify the base through repeated multiplication, not addition or direct retention. \n\nThis aligns with misunderstanding power notation rather than arithmetic errors like multiplying base by exponent (which would produce 0) or adding the exponent (9 + 0 = 9). The critical flaw was not recognizing that \\( 9^0 \\) requires applying the zero-exponent property, distinct from arithmetic operations involving the exponent.",
