  "explanation": "Correct solution:  \nAdd 4 to both sides first:  \n\\( \\frac{m}{6} -4 +4 =24 +4 \\)  \nSimplifies to:  \n\\( \\frac{m}{6}=28 \\)  \n\nStudent's error:  \nRejected Jo's valid step while also rejecting Paul's invalid step.  \n\nFlawed reasoning:  \nThe student likely thought both operations (Jo's addition and Paul's multiplication) required simultaneous fraction elimination. They failed to recognize that Jo correctly isolated the variable term through inverse operations before addressing the denominator.  \n\nMisconception impact:  \nThis indicates a failure to understand sequential equation balancing - that addition/subtraction must be performed before multiplication/division when reversing operations, and that these steps can be executed independently.  \n\nDistinction:  \nUnlike related fraction-clearing errors (Paul's mistake), this error stems from rejecting valid inverse operations rather than misapplying multiplication distribution.",
