  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Tom: 0.03456 \u2192 2 sig figs (3 and 4). Next digit (5) rounds 4 \u2192 5 \u2192 0.035\n- Katie: 0.03456 \u2192 2 decimal places (0.03). Next digit (4) doesn't round up \u2192 0.03\n\nStudent's reasoning:\n- Likely treated both answers as requiring decimal place rounding\n- For Tom: Mistook \"2 significant figures\" as \"2 decimal places\" (incorrectly validated 0.03)\n- For Katie: Correct decimal place calculation but student rejected it\n\nFlaw:\n- Confused significant figures with decimal places in Tom's case\n- Applied decimal place logic to both scenarios, then likely compared both answers to 0.035 (incorrect standard)\n\nDistinction:\n- Not a simple rounding direction error (since 5 rounds up) or over-rounding\n- Specific confusion between two distinct precision systems caused dual rejection",
