  "explanation": "In a speed-time graph, acceleration is calculated as gradient (\u0394s/\u0394t). The correct calculation identifies the negative gradient (-0.8 m/s\u00b2) as deceleration. \n\nThe student incorrectly equated the gradient's numerical value (0.8) directly to instantaneous speed (0.8 m/s). \n\nThis error stems from treating the gradient's magnitude as a speed coordinate rather than recognizing it as a rate of speed change. The misconception conflates the slope's steepness (acceleration) with a specific y-axis value (speed). \n\nThis directly maps to confusing rate of change (acceleration) with absolute speed values, rather than errors about y-intercepts or distance. The student's focus on the gradient's scalar value (0.8) without considering its \u0394s/\u0394t meaning led to misinterpreting acceleration as instantaneous speed.",
