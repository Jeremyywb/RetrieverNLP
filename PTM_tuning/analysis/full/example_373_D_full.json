  "explanation": "The correct corresponding angle to \\( p \\) is found by identifying the angle in the same relative position at the other intersection of the transversal. Since \\( p \\) and \\( A \\) are vertical angles, the corresponding angle to \\( p \\) (equivalent to \\( A \\)) would align with \\( C \\), as both occupy matching positions relative to the transversal and parallel lines.\n\nThe student incorrectly selected \\( D \\), which is vertically opposite \\( C \\). Their reasoning likely conflated vertical angles (which are equal but share a vertex) with corresponding angles (which are equal but positioned across different intersections). They observed that \\( D = C \\) due to vertical angles but failed to recognize that corresponding angles require matching positions across parallel lines, not merely equality. \n\nThis error aligns with misapplying vertical angle properties to a correspondence relationship, distinct from confusing alternate/co-interior angles (which involve alternating sides) or misjudging visual similarity alone. The core flaw was prioritizing angle equality over positional criteria.",
