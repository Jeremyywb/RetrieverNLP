  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n1. First division: Rectangle split into 2 equal parts \u2192 each part = 1/2\n2. Second division: One 1/2 part split into 2 \u2192 each new part = 1/2 \u00d7 1/2 = 1/4\n3. Third division: One 1/4 part split into 2 \u2192 each new part = 1/4 \u00d7 1/2 = 1/8\nTotal shaded: 1/8\n\nStudent's Incorrect Reasoning:\n- Likely interpreted each split as designating a \"whole\" section rather than subdividing prior fractions:\n   - First split: 1 shaded half (incorrectly treated as 1 whole)\n   - Second split: Another \"whole\" in the same way\n   - Third split: Another \"whole\"\n   - Total: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (then normalized to 1 due to confusion)\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nThe student failed to recognize that subsequent splits apply only to the already divided portion, not the entire shape. By treating each subdivided section as a new whole instead of a fraction of the original, they conflated partial areas with the total area. This matches the misconception of not anchoring subdivisions to the original whole in visual models.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nThe error stems from misapplying the whole reference frame across subdivisions, not from unequal parts or simplification errors. Equal partitioning occurred at each step, but the student lost track of the cumulative fractional relationship to the initial whole.",
