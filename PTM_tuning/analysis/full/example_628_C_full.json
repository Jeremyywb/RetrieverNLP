  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Given \\( \\frac{1}{3}A = 12 \\), so \\( A = 12 \\times 3 = 36 \\)\n2. Then \\( \\frac{1}{2}A = 36 \\div 2 = 18 \\)\n\nStudent's error:\nThey likely calculated \\( A = 12 \\times 3 = 36 \\), then incorrectly treated this total as the answer to \"\\( \\frac{1}{2}A \\)\" instead of performing the required division.\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student recognized that finding \\( \\frac{1}{3}A \\) required multiplying by 3, but misunderstood the subsequent operation needed for \\( \\frac{1}{2}A \\). They conflated the whole amount (36) with the requested fraction of it, failing to apply the second fraction operation after determining A.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis differs from \"doubles instead of halves\" (which would yield 24 if applied to 12) or \"multiplying by denominator\" (which would incorrectly use 2 instead of 1/2). The error specifically stems from correctly finding A but then misinterpreting which quantity the question required.\n\nThe misconception directly caused stopping at the total rather than computing the specified fraction of it, despite having correctly determined A first.",
