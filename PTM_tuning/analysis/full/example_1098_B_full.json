  "explanation": "The correct simplification cancels the common factor of \\( (3x+1) \\) and reduces \\( \\frac{12}{3} \\) to 4:\n\\[\n\\frac{(3x+1)}{3} \\times \\frac{12}{(3x-1)(3x+1)} = \\frac{\\cancel{(3x+1)}}{3} \\times \\frac{12}{(3x-1)\\cancel{(3x+1)}} = \\frac{4}{3x-1}.\n\\]\nThe student's answer \\( \\frac{4(3x+1)}{(3x-1)(3x+1)} \\) shows they correctly set up the multiplication but failed to cancel \\( (3x+1) \\). This indicates they recognized the common factor but did not complete the simplification step, leaving identical factors in both numerator and denominator. The error stems from stopping prematurely after multiplication without simplifying fully. This aligns with the primary misconception of incomplete simplification, not a misunderstanding of division application or term isolation, as the structure of their answer confirms they handled the operations correctly but neglected reduction.",
