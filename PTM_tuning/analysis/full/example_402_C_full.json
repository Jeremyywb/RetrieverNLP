  "explanation": "The correct simplification requires dividing numerator and denominator by their GCD (13):  \n13 \u00f7 13 = 1  \n78 \u00f7 13 = 6  \nResult: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).  \n\nThe student likely canceled individual digits in \"13\" and \"78\":  \n- Mistakenly canceled the \"3\" in 13 and \"7\" in 78 (as visually similar digits),  \n- Resulting in \\( \\frac{1}{6\\text{ (from 8 after removing 7)}} \\), but incorrectly wrote \\( \\frac{1}{66} \\).  \n\nThis stems from treating digits as separate entities to cancel (e.g., \"3\" and \"7\") rather than recognizing 13 and 78 as whole numbers. The error is distinct from subtraction errors (which would alter values) or omitting steps (which wouldn\u2019t produce digit-specific cancellation). The core flaw is invalid digit manipulation, not misunderstanding factors or arithmetic operations.",
