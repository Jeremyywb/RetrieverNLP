  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 2.5 \\times 60 = 150 \\)  \nStudent's calculation: \\( 2.5 \\times 100 = 250 \\)  \n\nThe student treated the decimal \\( 2.5 \\) as representing a base-100 system (like currency), multiplying by 100 instead of 60. This assumes \\( 0.5 \\) hours equals 50 minutes (half of 100), not 30 minutes (half of 60). The error stems from incorrectly applying a base-100 conversion to time, where minutes are base-60.  \n\nThis is distinct from simply ignoring the decimal point (which would produce \\( 25 \\times 60 = 1500 \\)) or assuming 10 minutes per hour (which would yield \\( 25 \\)). The specific confusion was interpreting the decimal fraction as hundredths of an hour rather than sixtieths.",
