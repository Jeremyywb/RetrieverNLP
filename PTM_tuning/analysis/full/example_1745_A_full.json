  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes that in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. Since \\(BC = 8\\, \\text{cm}\\), \\(AC\\) must also be \\(8\\, \\text{cm}\\). \n\nThe student likely ignored the definition of an equilateral triangle and assumed \\(AC\\) differs from \\(BC\\). For example, they might have incorrectly subtracted \\(1\\) from \\(8\\) without justification, arriving at \\(7\\, \\text{cm}\\). \n\nThis error stems from a failure to apply the property that equilateral triangles have three equal sides. The student treated the triangle as if it were scalene or isosceles, where sides might differ, rather than leveraging the given classification. \n\nThe misconception directly connects to not using the defining property of the shape (all sides equal), distinguishing it from errors like misapplying formulas or forgetting relationships between specific segments. The answer \\(7\\) lacks geometric justification, aligning with the listed primary misconception rather than unrelated calculation mistakes.",
