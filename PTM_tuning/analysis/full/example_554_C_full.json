  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nUsing points (0,0) and (6,-4):\n\\( m = \\frac{-4 - 0}{6 - 0} = -\\frac{4}{6} = -\\frac{2}{3} \\)\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n\\( m = \\frac{6 - 0}{-4 - 0} = \\frac{6}{-4} = -\\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\nThe student reversed the numerator and denominator by calculating \\( \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y} \\) instead of \\( \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\). This occurred because they treated the x-coordinate difference as the vertical change and y-coordinate difference as the horizontal change, effectively inverting the standard axes interpretation. \n\nThis directly stems from misattributing which axis represents which variable, as they processed the coordinates as (y,x) instead of (x,y) when calculating changes. This matches the axes-labelling misconception better than formula confusion, as the reciprocal relationship between their answer and the correct slope specifically indicates a coordinate reversal rather than a general misunderstanding of slope calculation steps. The error isn't about scale matching (axes scales are irrelevant when using explicit coordinates) or basic slope formula ignorance (they performed a division but inverted the variables).",
