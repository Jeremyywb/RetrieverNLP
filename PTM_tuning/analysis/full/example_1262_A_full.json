  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (1 + 0.1 + 0.01) \u00f7 3 = 1.11 \u00f7 3 = 0.37  \nStudent's incorrect calculation: 1 \u00f7 3 \u2248 0.333  \n\nThe student divided only the first number (1) by 3, excluding the other values. This indicates they treated a single data point as the total \"sum\" instead of aggregating all values first. The misconception conflates the individual value with the required summation step in mean calculation.  \n\nThis error aligns with dividing a single element by the count rather than the total sum, distinct from confusing median/mean (which would yield 0.1) or decimal-fraction equivalence errors. The 0.333 result directly stems from isolating the first term, not misapplying division properties or misordering operations.",
