  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The constant of proportionality is \\( 11 \\div 3 \\), as scale factor equals image length \\(\\div\\) original length.\n\nStudent's error: They calculated \\( 3 \\times 11 \\), treating multiplication as the direct operation to relate original and image lengths.\n\nReasoning flaw: The student conflated the operation needed to compute a proportional relationship. To determine how many times larger \\( Q \\) is than \\( P \\), division (image/original) is required. Instead, they multiplied the lengths, incorrectly assuming proportionality is found through a product rather than a quotient.\n\nMisconception link: This reflects a failure to recognize that proportionality requires identifying the multiplier \\( k \\) such that \\( 3 \\times k = 11 \\). The student bypassed solving for \\( k \\), directly multiplying the given values without isolating the scale factor.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike errors where division is reversed (original/image), the student avoided division entirely. Their error stems from misapplying multiplication as the primary tool for relating proportional quantities, not confusion over division direction.",
