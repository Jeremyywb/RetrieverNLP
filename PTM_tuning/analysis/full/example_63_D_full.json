  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \nStarting from the rightmost digit:  \n2 - \u2605 requires borrowing. 12 - \u2605 = 3 \u2192 \u2605 = 9 (with 5\u21924 in tens place). Subsequent columns confirm this works.  \n\nStudent's error:  \nThey likely computed 2 - \u2605 = 3 directly (no borrowing), concluding it's impossible because 2 < \u2605 would require a negative result.  \n\nReasoning flaw:  \nThe student treated subtraction as strictly left-to-right digit comparisons without regrouping. They assumed 2 - \u2605 = 3 must hold without borrowing, leading to a contradiction.  \n\nMisconception link:  \nThey believed subtraction requires the top digit to be larger than the bottom digit in every column, invalidating the problem when this isn\u2019t true.  \n\nDistinction:  \nThis differs from \"subtracts smallest from largest\" (which would yield 9 via 5-2=3) or compensation errors. The core issue was declaring impossibility rather than attempting regrouping.",
