  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (2+2+3+3+2)/5 = 12/5 = 2.4  \nStudent's error: Likely calculated (2+2+3+3+2)/4 = 12/4 = 3  \n\nThe student divided by 4 instead of 5, indicating they miscounted the dataset's total entries. This aligns with a failure to account for all data points when determining the divisor, distinct from listed misconceptions about zeros or not dividing at all.  \n\nCrucially, their answer matches 12/4 rather than median (2) or mode (2), ruling out confusion with those measures. The error stems specifically from an incorrect divisor choice, not from conflating mean with other central tendencies or arithmetic oversights.",
