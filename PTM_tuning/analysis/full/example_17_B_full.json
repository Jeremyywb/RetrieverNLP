  "explanation": "Correct calculation begins with addition:  \n(2n\u22121) + (2m+1)  \nStudent instead multiplied:  \n(2n\u22121)(2m+1)  \n\nThe student substituted multiplication for addition when representing the sum of two odd numbers. This directly caused the subsequent expansion and factorization to erroneously produce an odd expression (2(...)+1) instead of an even one.  \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the required operation in the proof (addition of numbers, not multiplication of expressions). This matches the \"multiplies rather than adds\" misconception, as the student's first step already diverges through incorrect operation choice.  \n\nDistinction: The error is not about misunderstanding 2n's parity or accidental addition/multiplication reversal in later steps \u2013 the core flaw is the initial substitution of multiplication for addition when modeling the problem.",
