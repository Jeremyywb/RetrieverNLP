  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the explicit coordinate (12:00, 5) provided in the plotted points, yielding \\( 5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\). The student likely estimated \\( 4.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\) by visually interpolating between gridlines on the graph's vertical axis instead of using the given data. This suggests they misinterpreted the axis scaling, possibly assuming minor grid divisions represented \\( 0.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\) increments when the actual scale had larger intervals (e.g., major divisions at \\( 2^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\)). The error stems from prioritizing visual estimation over precise coordinate reading, distinct from assuming uniform axis scales or misreading intersections. The key flaw was treating the graph as requiring approximation rather than direct extraction of the stated data point.",
