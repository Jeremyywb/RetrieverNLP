  "explanation": "Correct first step: Subtract 8 from both sides to get \\(x^2 +7x -8 =0\\), enabling factoring or quadratic formula.\n\nStudent's error: Dividing by \\(x\\) produces \\(x +7 = \\frac{8}{x}\\), which introduces a reciprocal term and complicates solving. This action assumes division by \\(x\\) will simplify the equation's structure.\n\nThe student mistakenly prioritized eliminating a variable term through division rather than establishing a standard quadratic form. Dividing by \\(x\\) (1) excludes the potential solution \\(x=0\\) (though invalid here) and (2) transforms it into a mixed-degree equation requiring more advanced methods.\n\nThis directly stems from believing division is universally applicable for simplification, rather than recognizing that quadratic equations require rearrangement to \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\) through addition/subtraction. \n\nIt's distinct from algebraic division errors (e.g., mishandling \\(x^2/x\\)) because the flaw lies in selecting an inappropriate operation rather than executing division incorrectly. The error also isn't about order of operations reversal but misjudging equation structure requirements.",
