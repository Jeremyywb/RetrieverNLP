  "explanation": "The correct simplification combines like terms through addition: \\( e + e + e = (1+1+1)e = 3e \\). \n\nThe student wrote \\( e3 \\), suggesting they recognized three instances of \\( e \\) but placed the coefficient after the variable. \n\nThe error stems from conflating the notation for repeated addition (which produces \\( 3e \\)) with an incorrect multiplicative format. The student likely interpreted \\( e + e + e \\) as equivalent to \\( e \\times 3 \\), then misapplied notation by writing the numerical factor after \\( e \\), as in concatenation (e.g., \"e3\" instead of \\( 3e \\)). \n\nThis directly reflects a confusion between additive combination (where coefficients precede variables) and multiplicative notation conventions. It differs from related misconceptions because the student correctly counted the terms (showing awareness of coefficients) but erred in symbol placement, not in understanding the existence of coefficients or multiplication mechanics.",
