  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Tripling 8 means 8 \u00d7 3 = 24.\n\nStudent's error: They interpreted \"triple\" as writing \"8\" three times consecutively (888), not multiplying by 3.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student confused numerical operations with digit manipulation. They treated \"triple\" as a request to repeat the digit rather than perform arithmetic multiplication.\n\nMisconception link: This error directly stems from interpreting mathematical terminology (\"triple\") as a command to concatenate digits instead of calculating a product.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike adding (which would still yield 24) or cubing (which produces 512), the error uniquely involves digit placement without applying any numerical operation.\n\nFinal diagnosis: The student substituted the mathematical meaning of \"triple\" with a literal interpretation of repeating digits, bypassing arithmetic entirely.",
