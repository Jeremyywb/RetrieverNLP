  "explanation": "The correct equivalence \\( a(b+c) \\equiv (b+c) \\times a \\) holds via the commutative property of multiplication. Katie's claim \\( a(b+c) \\equiv ab+c \\) omits distributing \\( a \\) to \\( c \\), making it incorrect. \n\nThe student likely rejected Tom's equivalence because they interpreted the order of \\( a \\) and \\( (b+c) \\) as non-interchangeable, failing to recognize that multiplication is commutative. This caused them to incorrectly dismiss a valid equivalence. Simultaneously, they correctly identified Katie's error but extended this skepticism to Tom's valid application of commutativity. \n\nThis aligns with a failure to recognize that multiplication order doesn't affect equivalence, distinct from a distributive property error (which applies to Katie's mistake). The student's reasoning conflated structural order dependence (misapplying commutativity) with distribution errors, leading to the conclusion that both were invalid.",
