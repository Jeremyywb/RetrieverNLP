  "explanation": "The correct reflection over the line y=x transforms (a,b) to (b,a). Applying this to point P (0,3) yields (3,0).\n\nThe student likely calculated (2,3) by reflecting over a vertical line at x=1 instead of y=x. They subtracted the original x-coordinate (0) from x=1 to get a distance of 1, then added this twice to the x-coordinate (0 + 2 = 2), preserving the y-coordinate. \n\nThis error stems from assuming the reflection line was vertical rather than diagonal. The misconception caused them to misidentify the reflection axis and apply horizontal reflection rules instead of coordinate-swapping. \n\nThis distinguishes from rotating (which would alter both coordinates asymmetrically) or reflecting in the x/y-axis (which would invert one coordinate, not shift it). The mistake specifically shows a substitution of the actual mirror line with an assumed vertical alternative.",
