  "explanation": "**Correct Calculation:**\n1. Factor numerator: \\( m^{2}-2m-3 = (m-3)(m+1) \\)\n2. Cancel common factor: \\( \\frac{(m-3)(m+1)}{m-3} = m+1 \\)\n\n**Student's Likely Error:**\n- Attempted to factor the numerator but failed to identify numbers that both add to \\(-2\\) (coefficient of \\(m\\)) **and** multiply to \\(-3\\) (constant term). \n- May have incorrectly assumed valid factors only need to satisfy the sum condition, leading them to abandon factoring.\n\n**Reasoning Flaw:**\nThe student prioritized matching the sum (\\(-2\\)) without verifying the product (\\(-3\\)). This caused them to overlook the valid pair \\(-3\\) and \\(1\\), concluding the numerator was irreducible. \n\n**Connection to Misconception:**\nThe error stems from treating the sum of factors as the sole requirement for factoring quadratics, neglecting the product constraint. \n\n**Distinction from Related Misconceptions:**\nThis is not a case of ignoring algebraic factors entirely (e.g., only checking numerical factors) or misapplying difference of squares. The failure specifically lies in the quadratic factoring step.",
