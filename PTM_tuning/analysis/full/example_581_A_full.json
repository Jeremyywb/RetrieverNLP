  "explanation": "The correct sequence follows \\( n^3 \\): \\( 1=1^3 \\), \\( 8=2^3 \\), \\( 27=3^3 \\), \\( 64=4^3 \\). The student incorrectly identified the pattern as \\( n^2 \\), despite terms like \\( 8 \\) and \\( 27 \\) not matching \\( 2^2=4 \\) or \\( 3^2=9 \\). The error stems from conflating exponentiation operations, assuming the growth rate aligned with squares rather than recognizing the faster progression of cubes. This directly corresponds to confusing squaring with cubing, as the student failed to verify terms beyond the initial \\( 1 \\), which satisfies both \\( 1^2 \\) and \\( 1^3 \\). The distinction from other misconceptions (e.g., prime confusion) is evident because the answer explicitly references squares, not primes or a lack of cube knowledge. The flaw lies in misapplying exponent rules rather than arithmetic errors or terminology gaps.",
