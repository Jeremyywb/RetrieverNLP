  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\)\n\nStudent's incorrect steps: \\( \\frac{10}{2} = -5 \\)\n\nThe student correctly substituted \\( h=10 \\) but introduced an unwarranted negative sign in the final answer. This indicates they interpreted the division expression as requiring a negative result despite no negative components in the original problem. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying a negative sign to the outcome of a purely positive division operation. This directly aligns with the misconception of arbitrarily attaching negativity to results, rather than errors in substitution, operation order, or sign interpretation within the expression itself. \n\nIt differs from related misconceptions like misreading \"/\" as subtraction or altering the operation, as the student preserved the division structure but added a sign change post-calculation.",
