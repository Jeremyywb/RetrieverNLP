  "explanation": "To determine the smallest number of packets where bread rolls and hot dogs quantities match, one must find the LCM of 18 and 15. The LCM of 18 (2\u00d73\u00b2) and 15 (3\u00d75) is 2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75 = 90. This requires 90\u00f718=5 packets of rolls and 90\u00f715=6 packets of hot dogs.\n\nThe student calculated 18\u00d715=270, treating the product as the solution. This error stems from misapplying multiplication to combine quantities rather than seeking a shared multiple. The student likely assumed \"same total number\" requires multiplying the two packet sizes, not recognizing that LCM identifies the first overlapping quantity in their multiples sequence.\n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of confusing LCM with product in real-world scenarios. The error differs from HCF confusion (which would yield 3, insufficient for whole packets) or general multiple identification issues, as the student specifically used multiplication instead of LCM calculation.",
