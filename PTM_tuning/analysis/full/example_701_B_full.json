  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes the original sequence formula as \\( 3n + 2 \\), yielding 302 for \\( n=100 \\). When columns reduce from 3 to 2 squares each, the new formula becomes \\( 2n + 2 \\), giving \\( 202 \\). \n\nThe student likely subtracted 2 squares total (e.g., \\( 302 - 2 = 300 \\)), treating the removal as a fixed reduction unrelated to \\( n \\). This assumes a constant number of columns (e.g., 2 columns) instead of recognizing the number of columns equals \\( n \\), requiring \\( 100 \\) removals. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the term-to-term rule as a fixed subtraction (e.g., \"remove 2 squares\") rather than scaling the removal with \\( n \\). This aligns with failing to recognize how the visual pattern's structure (number of columns) grows linearly with \\( n \\), distinguishing it from misconceptions about linear sequences' constant rate of change.",
