  "explanation": "The correct interpretation associates probability \\( 0 \\) with impossibility. The student's answer \"Certain\" requires interpreting \\( 0 \\) as absolute certainty. This reversal implies they mapped the numerical value to the opposite end of the probability scale. For example:\n\n- Correct reasoning: \\( 0 \\rightarrow \\) impossible, \\( 1 \\rightarrow \\) certain\n- Student's error: \\( 0 \\rightarrow \\) certain, \\( 1 \\rightarrow \\) impossible\n\nThe flaw stems from inverting the direction of the probability-value relationship. This directly corresponds to misattributing the meaning of numerical bounds in probability, not a misunderstanding of complementary probabilities (\\( 1 - p \\)) or arithmetic errors with probability ranges. The error is purely about scale orientation, not miscalculating event complements or exceeding valid probability bounds.",
