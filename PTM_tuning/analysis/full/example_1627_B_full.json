  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Area under section A (triangle) = \u00bd \u00d7 10s \u00d7 20m/s = 100m.\n\nStudent's error: Likely calculated 20 \u00f7 10 = 2m. \n\nFlaw: They divided velocity by time instead of computing the area. This stems from treating distance as a direct division of axis values (velocity \u00f7 time) rather than recognizing the multiplicative relationship (distance = average velocity \u00d7 time, requiring multiplication). \n\nDistinction: Unlike line-length errors (which would involve Pythagorean calculations) or scale misreads (producing answers like 1m), this error specifically replaces required multiplication with division. The direct substitution of division for proportional scaling matches the stated primary misconception.",
