  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times (8 + x) \\times 5 = 30\\). Solving:  \n\\(\\frac{1}{2}(8 + x) = 6 \\Rightarrow 8 + x = 12 \\Rightarrow x = 4\\).\n\nStudent's likely steps:  \n\\(x \\times 5 = 30 \\Rightarrow x = 6\\).\n\nFlaw: The student treated the trapezium as a single-base shape (like a rectangle), using only the unknown base \\(x\\) multiplied by the height. The correct formula requires averaging the two parallel sides first. This indicates a failure to recognize that the trapezium's area depends on both bases, not just one. The error aligns with the misconception of applying single-base formulas (e.g., rectangle area) to trapeziums. It is distinct from simply not knowing the formula or multiplying the parallel sides directly, as the error specifically omits the averaging step.",
