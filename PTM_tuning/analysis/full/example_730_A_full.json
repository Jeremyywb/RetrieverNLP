  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 60% of 20 parts = 0.60 \u00d7 20 = 12 shaded parts.\n\nStudent's error: Likely calculated 10% of 60 (0.10 \u00d7 60 = 6) instead of 60% of 20. \n\nFlawed reasoning: The student treated the percentage value (60%) as the total quantity to take 10% from, rather than applying 60% to the actual total (20 parts). \n\nMisapplication: This reflects confusion about which number the percentage applies to. The student substituted the percentage itself (60) as the base for calculating 10%, rather than using the total parts (20) to compute 60%. \n\nDistinction: This differs from \"dividing by 10 gives 1%\" because the error stems from misidentifying the base value for the percentage, not a systematic division error. \n\nConclusion: The student incorrectly interpreted the problem as asking for 10% of the percentage value rather than the specified percentage of the given whole.",
