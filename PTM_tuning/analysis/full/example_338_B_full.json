  "explanation": "To find an equivalent fraction for \\( \\frac{4}{6} \\) with denominator 12:\n- Correct method: Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 \u2192 \\( \\frac{4 \\times 2}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{8}{12} \\).\n\nStudent's error: Kept the numerator as 4, writing \\( \\frac{4}{12} \\).\n\nThe student recognized the denominator needed scaling (6\u219212) but failed to apply the same multiplier (2) to the numerator. This reflects a failure to maintain equivalence through proportional scaling of both terms. The error stems from treating the numerator and denominator independently rather than preserving the multiplicative relationship.\n\nThis is distinct from misconceptions about equal numerators/denominators, as the student did change the denominator but neglected the required numerator adjustment. The core issue is the lack of coordinated scaling, not a belief that equal numerators alone ensure equivalence.",
