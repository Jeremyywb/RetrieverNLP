  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n58 \u00d7 22:\n1. Multiply 58 \u00d7 2 (units place): \n   8\u00d72=16 (write 6, carry 1)\n   5\u00d72=10 + 1 = 11 \u2192 partial product 116\n2. Multiply 58 \u00d7 20 (tens place):\n   8\u00d72=16 (write 6 in tens column, carry 1)\n   5\u00d72=10 + 1 = 11 \u2192 partial product 1160\n3. Sum: 116 + 1160 = 1276 \u2192 units digit 6\n\nStudent's error:\nWhen calculating 8\u00d72=16:\n- Wrote 1 in the units column (tens digit of 16)\n- Carried 6 instead of 1\n\nThis caused:\nFirst partial product to incorrectly start with 1 in the units place, followed by 16 (from 5\u00d72 + carried 6 = 16), making the final sum's units digit inherit the initial misplaced 1.\n\nFlawed reasoning:\nThe student placed the tens digit of the multiplication result (1 from 16) directly in the units column instead of the correct units digit (6). This reflects a misunderstanding of how to record digits when a product exceeds 9, specifically misapplying which digit belongs in the current column vs. being carried.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike errors where carries are omitted entirely, the student preserved both digits but reversed their placement. The error also differs from left-starting approaches, as the multiplication sequence remained right-to-left.\n\nThe misconception directly caused the units digit error by conflating the roles of the product's digits during recording, not from omitting carries or misaligning steps.",
