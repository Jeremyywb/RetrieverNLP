  "explanation": "The correct factorisation is \\( p(p-5) \\), found by factoring out the greatest common factor \\( p \\). \n\nThe student incorrectly wrote \\( (p+5)(p-5) \\), which expands to \\( p^2 - 25 \\), not \\( p^2 -5p \\). \n\nThe error stems from treating \\( p^2 -5p \\) as a difference of squares (\\( a^2 - b^2 \\)) rather than recognizing it as a binomial with a common factor. The student likely misidentified the linear term \\(-5p\\) as a squared term \\(-25\\), falsely triggering the \\((a+b)(a-b)\\) pattern. \n\nThis aligns with the misconception that expressions like \\( x^2 - a^2x \\) qualify for difference of squares factorisation. The related misconception about quadratic coefficients coming from multiplying factors in brackets does not apply here, as the error involves pattern misrecognition rather than arithmetic missteps during expansion.",
