  "explanation": "To convert 0.909 to a percentage, the correct calculation is \\( 0.909 \\times 100 = 90.9\\% \\). The student's answer of \\( 909\\% \\) suggests they calculated \\( 0.909 \\times 1000 \\) instead. \n\nThis error occurs when shifting the decimal point three places to the right (equivalent to multiplying by 1000), likely due to misinterpreting the relationship between decimal places and percentage conversion. The misconception directly links to using an incorrect scale factor (1000 instead of 100), as the student's result is exactly 10x larger than the correct answer. \n\nThis distinguishes it from other misconceptions like adding a % symbol without conversion (which would leave the number as 0.909%) or rejecting decimal percentages (which might lead to rounding to 91%).",
