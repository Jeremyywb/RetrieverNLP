  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Original number: 34590.8549\n- First decimal place: 8 (tenths place)\n- Second decimal digit: 5 (hundredths place)\n- Round up tenths digit: 8 \u2192 9\n- Final result: 34590.9\n\nStudent's calculation:\n- Incorrectly rounded both tenths and units places:\n  34590.8 \u2192 34591.9\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student added 1 to both the tenths digit (8\u21929) and units digit (0\u21921). When rounding up the tenths place from 8 to 9, only the tenths digit should change. The misconception stems from mistakenly applying a carryover operation to the units place when no overflow occurred (since 8+1=9, not 10). This is distinct from errors that only modify adjacent digits during 9\u219210 transitions or change too many decimals. The error specifically shows unnecessary modification of a higher place value during a non-overflow rounding operation.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis isn't merely rounding multiple digits (which would involve changing other decimals) nor failing to propagate a 9\u219210 carryover. The error uniquely demonstrates adding to an unrelated higher place value during a single-digit round-up.",
