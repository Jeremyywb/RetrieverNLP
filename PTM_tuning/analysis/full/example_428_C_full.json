  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires finding a number \\( x \\) such that \\( x^4 = 16 \\). Since \\( 2^4 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16 \\), \\( \\sqrt[4]{16} = 2 \\).\n\nThe student likely computed \\( 16 \\div 4 = 4 \\), treating the fourth root as division by the index. This reflects a misunderstanding of roots as operations requiring inverse exponentiation, not division. \n\nThe error stems from interpreting the root symbol\u2019s index as a divisor rather than the exponent\u2019s inverse. This directly aligns with the misconception that roots involve dividing the radicand by the index. \n\nThis differs from confusing exponents (e.g., answering 4 due to the index being 4) or misapplying squaring (which would produce 16, not 4). The error specifically shows division by the index, not confusion between root types or exponent properties.",
