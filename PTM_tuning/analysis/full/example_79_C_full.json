  "explanation": "To solve \\(x^2 - x - 6 \\geq 0\\), factor the quadratic: \\((x - 3)(x + 2) \\geq 0\\). The parabola opens upward, so the inequality holds when \\(x \\leq -2\\) (left of the first root) or \\(x \\geq 3\\) (right of the second root), written as a union: \\(\\{x \\leq -2\\} \\cup \\{x \\geq 3\\}\\).\n\nThe student incorrectly wrote \\(\\{-2 \\geq x \\geq 3\\}\\), which implies \\(x\\) simultaneously satisfies \\(-2 \\geq x\\) and \\(x \\geq 3\\)\u2014an impossibility. This error stems from misusing a two-tailed inequality to connect disjoint intervals. The student treated the union of two separate regions as a single compound inequality, violating the syntax of inequality chains (which require a monotonic progression). This matches the misconception that two-tailed inequalities can arbitrarily place constants in the middle, rather than recognizing they must describe continuous ranges. Unlike confusion about union/intersection or direction symbols, the core flaw is invalidly compressing two distinct intervals into one expression.",
