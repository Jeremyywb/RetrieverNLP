  "explanation": "The correct calculation starts at -16 and adds 3 four times (for the 5th term):  \n-16 \u2192 -13 \u2192 -10 \u2192 -7 \u2192 -4.  \n\nThe student likely subtracted 3 repeatedly:  \n-16 \u2192 -19 \u2192 -22 \u2192 -25 \u2192 -28.  \n\nThe error stems from misapplying addition of a positive number to a negative starting point. The student incorrectly treated \"counting up in threes\" as moving leftward on the number line (subtracting 3), rather than rightward (adding 3). This aligns with the misconception that adding a positive number to a negative number increases its negativity, reversing the actual effect.  \n\nThis is distinct from simply reversing the term-to-term rule (e.g., subtracting instead of adding) because the error specifically involves misjudging the directional impact of addition on negatives. The answer being more negative (-28 vs. -16) confirms this, rather than a subtraction-commutativity error.",
