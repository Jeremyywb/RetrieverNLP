  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nTo find the first term from the third term (9), reverse both operations in inverse order:\n1. Reverse \"divide by 2\" first: 9 \u00d7 2 = 18\n2. Reverse \"+7\": 18 - 7 = 11 (second term)\n3. Repeat for second term: 11 \u00d7 2 = 22; 22 - 7 = 15 (first term)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nThey likely performed forward operations once on the third term:\n1. Applied \"+7\" then \"\u00f72\" to 9: (9 + 7) \u00f7 2 = 8\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student treated the given operations as instructions to modify the known term (third term) directly, rather than reversing them. They applied \"+7 \u2192 \u00f72\" to 9 instead of undoing the sequence \"\u00f72 \u2192 +7\" through inverse operations \"\u00d72 \u2192 -7\" in reverse order.\n\nMisconception linkage:\nThis error stems from believing forward operations should be reused to find earlier terms, not recognizing that backtracking requires inverse operations in reversed order. It specifically matches applying given operations rather than inverses, not merely reversing operation order without inversion.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike misconceptions about term position or operation order reversal alone, this error shows direct forward application of the rule to the output term instead of systematic inversion.",
