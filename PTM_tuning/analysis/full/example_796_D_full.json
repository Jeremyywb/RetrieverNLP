  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(12^2 = 12 \\times 12 = 144\\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\(12^2 \\rightarrow 12\\) written twice as \"1212\".  \n\nThe student treated exponentiation as digit repetition rather than multiplication. They interpreted the exponent \"2\" as an instruction to duplicate the base's digits sequentially, concatenating \"12\" and \"12\". This conflates squaring with literal digit repetition, bypassing the required multiplication step.  \n\nThis differs from writing the exponent as an appended digit (e.g., \\(12^2 \\rightarrow 122\\)) or combining digits during multiplication (e.g., \\(12 \\times 2 = 24 \\rightarrow 124\\)). The error specifically stems from misinterpreting the exponent's role as a repetition operator for the entire numeral, not a mathematical operation.",
