  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\times 7 = 0.05 \\times 7 \\), so \\( ? = 0.05 \\).\n\nStudent's error: They calculated \\( 20 \\times 7 \\), setting \\( ? = 20 \\).\n\nFlaw: The student treated the denominator of the fraction as the multiplier instead of its reciprocal. They directly multiplied 7 by 20 (the denominator) rather than by \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\), misapplying the relationship between fractions and multiplication.\n\nMisconception link: This matches the belief that \"finding a fraction of an amount means multiplying by the denominator,\" bypassing the division operation inherent in unit fractions. The error stems from reversing the fraction's role as a scalar multiplier.\n\nDistinction: This differs from confusing part/whole (which would involve incorrect quantity comparisons) or misinterpreting fractions as denominator/numerator division (which would yield \\( \\frac{20}{1} \\) here). The error specifically substitutes reciprocal operations for denominators. \n\nFinal confirmation: The student's answer aligns precisely with multiplying by the fraction's denominator, not other listed misinterpretations.",
