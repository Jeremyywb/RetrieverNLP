  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires converting 2 km to 2000 m, then computing \\(\\frac{60}{2000} \\times 100 = 3\\%\\).  \nThe student likely calculated \\(\\frac{60}{2} \\times 100 = 60\\%\\) without unit conversion.  \nThe error stems from treating the numerator (60 m) and denominator (2 km) as directly comparable quantities in their original units.  \nThis shows a failure to recognize the necessity of uniform units in ratio calculations, as percentages require proportional comparison of like quantities.  \nThe answer \"60%\" aligns with mechanically appending a % symbol to the numerator's numerical value, distinct from unit conversion errors (which would yield values like 0.03% or 30% depending on the flawed conversion).  \nThe direct use of 60/2 without adjustment confirms the primary flaw was procedural omission of unit standardization rather than arithmetic errors in conversion factors.",
