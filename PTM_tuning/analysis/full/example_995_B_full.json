  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nSum of interior angles = (6-2)\u00d7180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\nEach interior angle = 720\u00b0 \u00f7 6 = 120\u00b0\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\nSum of interior angles = (8-2)\u00d7180\u00b0 = 1080\u00b0\nEach interior angle = 1080\u00b0 \u00f7 8 = 135\u00b0\n\nThe student incorrectly used n=8 (octagon) instead of n=6 (hexagon) when applying the formula. This caused them to calculate values for an octagon rather than a hexagon. The error stems from misidentifying the polygon's number of sides, directly matching the first related misconception. Other listed misconceptions would produce different errors: subtracting 1 from sides would yield 150\u00b0, while incorrect exterior angle subtraction would require a prior miscalculation of exterior angles. The precise match with octagon angles confirms the side-count confusion as the root cause.",
