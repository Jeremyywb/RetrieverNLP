  "explanation": "Correct calculation: A cube number equals \\( n^3 \\) where \\( n \\) is an integer (e.g., 8=2\u00b3, 27=3\u00b3). None of the answer choices matched this definition. \n\nStudent's error: Identified 3 as a cube number. \n\nReasoning flaw: The student likely computed \\( 1 \\times 3 = 3 \\), treating \"cubing\" as multiplying by 3 rather than \\( n \\times n \\times n \\). This conflates the exponentiation operation with scalar multiplication by 3. \n\nMisconception link: The error directly stems from misinterpreting \"cube\" as a linear multiplier (\u00d73) rather than a threefold product of the base. \n\nDistinguishing from related misconceptions: This differs from confusing cube numbers with primes (3 is prime but not a cube) or thinking cubes are multiples of 3 (e.g., 6 is a multiple of 3 but not a cube), as the error specifically misapplies the cubing operation itself.",
