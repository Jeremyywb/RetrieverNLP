  "explanation": "The correct calculation divides 360\u00b0 into eight equal parts (45\u00b0 each) for intercardinal directions. Northwest is 315\u00b0, calculated as 360\u00b0 - 45\u00b0 (clockwise from North). \n\nThe student likely:\n1. Correctly identified West as 270\u00b0\n2. Incorrectly assumed \"Northwest\" shares West's bearing\n3. Concluded 270\u00b0 without calculating the 45\u00b0 offset from North\n\nThis stems from misinterpreting directional labels as categorical rather than positional. The student treated \"West\" in \"Northwest\" as defining the bearing, ignoring the clockwise angular measurement from North. \n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception: treating diagram labels as absolute angle markers rather than deriving positions from a 360\u00b0 system. It differs from related errors like angle estimation or quarter-turn misunderstandings, as the error specifically substitutes a label's associated angle rather than miscalculating degrees.",
