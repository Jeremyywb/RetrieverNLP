  "explanation": "Correct volume units are cubic (e.g., m\u00b3, cm\u00b3). The student rejected m\u00b3, a valid volume unit, likely because they associated volume with 2D measurements. \n\nIf the answer 8.5 had units of m\u00b3, it would correctly represent volume. However, the student incorrectly deemed m\u00b3 invalid, suggesting they thought volume requires non-cubic units (e.g., square units). \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception that volume relates to 2D calculations, causing them to dismiss the cubic unit. Unlike confusing milliliters or mass, this error specifically shows a failure to associate cubic dimensions with volume. The student's reasoning conflated area (mm\u00b2) with volume, but their rejection of m\u00b3 (instead of mm\u00b2) isolates the 2D misconception.",
