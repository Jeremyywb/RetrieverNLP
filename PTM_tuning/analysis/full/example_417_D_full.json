  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the property \\( a^m \\times b^m = (a \\times b)^m \\):  \n\\( 3^2 \\times 4^2 = (3 \\times 4)^2 = 12^2 \\), confirming Paul's answer.  \n\nThe student likely computed \\( 3^2 = 9 \\) and \\( 4^2 = 16 \\), then multiplied: \\( 9 \\times 16 = 144 \\). They recognized Jo\u2019s \\( 12^4 \\) is incorrect but failed to see \\( 12^2 = 144 \\) matches their result.  \n\nThe flaw lies in not recognizing the equivalence of \\( (3 \\times 4)^2 \\) and \\( 3^2 \\times 4^2 \\). The student treated the operations as strictly sequential (compute exponents first, then multiply) without connecting this to Paul\u2019s combined-base approach.  \n\nThis stems from misunderstanding how exponents distribute over multiplication. The student rejected Paul\u2019s valid application of index laws, assuming separate computation was the only valid method.  \n\nThis differs from multiplying bases before exponents (e.g., \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\), then \\( 12^{2+2} \\)), which would align with Jo\u2019s error. Here, the issue is failing to recognize equivalent forms under index laws, not misapplying exponent addition.",
