  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n485 + 78 = 563  \n563 - 9 = 554  \n\nIncorrect path:\n485 - 78 = 407  \n407 - 9 = 398  \n\nThe student treated the \"+78\" as subtraction, likely assuming subtraction must occur when encountering two numbers. This reflects a belief that operations between adjacent numbers default to subtracting smaller values from larger ones, overriding the original addition symbol. This directly aligns with misapplying order-independent subtraction rules rather than following left-to-right operations. It differs from addition-priority errors, which would instead compute 485 + (78-9)=554. The computational steps themselves are error-free when following the flawed rule, confirming the error stems from misinterpreting operation order rather than arithmetic mistakes.",
