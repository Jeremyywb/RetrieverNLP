  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (5 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 3) \u00f7 5 = 12 \u00f7 5 = 2.4  \nStudent's calculation: Likely (5 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 3) \u00f7 5 \u2192 incorrectly rounded 2.4 to 2, or mistakenly used median  \nFlaw: The student either truncated the decimal (2.4 \u2192 2) without rounding properly or conflated the mean with the median. Sorting the data [0, 2, 2, 3, 5] yields a median of 2, which matches their answer.  \nMisconception link: The error stems from confusing the mean (average) with the median (middle value), not the mode (most frequent value).  \nDistinction: If they had confused mean with mode, they would have correctly identified 2 as the mode, but this doesn\u2019t explain why they omitted the decimal. The answer directly aligns with the median calculation.",
