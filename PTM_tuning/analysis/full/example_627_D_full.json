  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires multiplying 9 and -0.5:  \n\\(9 \\times (-0.5) = -4.5\\).  \n\nThe student likely computed \\(9 + (-0.5) = 8.5\\), replacing multiplication with addition.  \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the notation \\(ab\\) as requiring addition rather than multiplication. When variables (or numbers and variables) are adjacent, they represent a product, but the student treated them as a sum.  \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception that a variable next to a number implies addition. The 8.5 result matches the sum of 9 and -0.5, confirming the operation substitution.  \n\nDistinct from general \"adds instead of multiplies\" errors, this specifically involves misreading the notation\u2019s implied operation, not merely confusing when to add versus multiply in a broader context.  \n\nNo other related misconception (e.g., decimal placement or sign errors) explains the 8.5 result as precisely as the misinterpretation of adjacency as addition.",
