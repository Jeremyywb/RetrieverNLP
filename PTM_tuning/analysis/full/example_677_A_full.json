  "explanation": "The correct perimeter calculation requires summing all four sides: \\(2x + 2y\\).  \nThe student computed \\(x + y\\), omitting the doubling of both terms.  \nThe error stems from treating perimeter as a single pair of sides instead of two pairs.  \nThe misconception caused them to count only one instance of each dimension rather than recognizing the rectangle's two identical lengths and two identical widths.  \nThis directly matches adding length and width (a foundational formula misunderstanding) rather than confusion about area (which would involve multiplication) or shape properties (they correctly identified x/y as sides but misapplied the formula).  \nRelated misconceptions like area calculation or total shape ignorance are distinguishable by the absence of multiplication or misidentification of sides.",
