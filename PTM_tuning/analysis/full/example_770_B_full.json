  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 9 = \\frac{9}{5} = 1 \\frac{4}{5} \\).  \nStudent's error: Katie computed \\( \\frac{1 \\times 9}{5 \\times 9} = \\frac{9}{45} \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly treated the integer 9 as a denominator multiplier rather than a numerator multiplier. They multiplied both numerator and denominator by 9, altering the fraction's value unnecessarily. This stems from misapplying the rule for creating equivalent fractions (where numerator/denominator are scaled equally) to multiplication, conflating operations.  \n\nThe error matches the misconception of believing the integer should affect the denominator. It differs from \"multiplies by reciprocal\" (which would involve swapping terms) or \"adding numerators\" errors, as the student explicitly multiplied denominators. The result \\( \\frac{9}{45} \\) specifically reflects the flawed logic of treating the integer as a denominator factor rather than a numerator scalar.",
