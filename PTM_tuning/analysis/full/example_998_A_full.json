  "explanation": "The correct calculation maintains the original expression since \\( c + a \\) cannot be simplified further. The student incorrectly transformed \\( c + a \\) into \\( c a \\), merging the terms into a product. The error stems from conflating addition with multiplication: the student likely assumed combining two variables requires representing them as multiplied terms rather than recognizing they remain separate in a sum. This aligns with treating addition as equivalent to multiplication, distinct from merely omitting symbols or misreading adjacency. Unlike confusing notation (e.g., interpreting \\( ca \\) as addition), here the operation itself was misapplied, directly substituting addition with multiplication.",
