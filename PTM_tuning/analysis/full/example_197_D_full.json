  "explanation": "The correct answer requires recognizing that lines intersecting at a right angle are called \"perpendicular.\" The student answered \"particular,\" a word that sounds similar but has no mathematical relevance here. The error stems from substituting a phonetically similar term due to lack of precise vocabulary retention for geometric relationships. This aligns with a failure to associate the visual right-angle intersection with its exact terminology, rather than confusion with parallel/vertical distinctions or general crossing lines. The mistake is specifically lexical (misnaming) rather than conceptual (misinterpreting angle properties or orientation), differentiating it from the listed related misconceptions.",
