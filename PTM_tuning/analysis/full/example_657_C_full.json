  "explanation": "To compare 3050 and 3500 correctly:\n- Compare digits left-to-right: thousands (3=3) \u2192 hundreds (0<5). Thus, 3050<3500.\n\nThe student likely compared digits right-to-left:\n- Units: 0=0 \u2192 Tens: 5>0 \u2192 concluded 3050>3500.\n\nThis shows they reversed the standard left-to-right digit comparison order. The error stems from treating the tens digit as more significant than the hundreds digit due to incorrect directionality, not from misjudging digit count or numeral order. Unlike \"more digits = larger number\" misconceptions, both numbers here have equal digit counts. The flaw specifically involves prioritizing later digits over earlier ones.",
