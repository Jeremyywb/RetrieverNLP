  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(4 \\text{ km} \\times 0.6 \\text{ miles/km} = 2.4\\) miles  \nStudent's calculation: \\(4 + 0.6 = 4.6\\) miles  \n\nThe error occurred when the student substituted addition for multiplication in the conversion process. Instead of scaling the conversion factor (0.6 miles/km) by the distance (4 km), they combined the numerical values directly through addition. This reflects a failure to recognize that unit conversion requires proportional scaling through multiplication, not cumulative addition.  \n\nThe specific misconception manifests here as treating multiplicative relationships as additive ones. This differs from related misconceptions about \"product vs. add\" terminology, as the error stems from misapplying operations to quantities rather than misunderstanding vocabulary. The student used the given values correctly but chose the wrong arithmetic operation.",
