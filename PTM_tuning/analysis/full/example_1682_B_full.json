  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 10:45 + 2h = 12:45; 12:45 + 40m = 13:25.\n\nStudent's calculation: 10:45 + 2h40m = 01:25 (treating 12:45 + 40m as 1:25 AM instead of 1:25 PM).\n\nThe student correctly added hours and minutes but failed to convert 12-hour format to 24-hour notation when passing noon. They treated 12:45 + 40m as a midnight-to-noon cycle restart (01:25), not recognizing that times after 12:59 continue as 13:00 in 24-hour format. This directly stems from confusing AM/PM transitions at noon, where 12:XX PM becomes 13:XX in 24-hour time. The error differs from day-crossing errors (unlikely in a 2h40m journey) or simple hour miscounts (they counted 2h correctly to 12:45). The specific flaw was misinterpreting the 12\u21921 transition as AM reset rather than PM continuation.",
