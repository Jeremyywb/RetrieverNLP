  "explanation": "The correct reflection over \\( y=-x \\) transforms \\((a,b)\\) to \\((-b,-a)\\). For \\((4,-4)\\), this gives \\(-(-4) = 4\\) and \\(-4\\), resulting in \\((4,-4)\\). \n\nThe student computed \\((-4,4)\\), which matches swapping coordinates without sign changes. This indicates they applied the reflection rule for \\( y=x \\) (swapping \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)) instead of \\( y=-x \\). \n\nThe flaw stems from misattributing the reflection rule between \\( y=x \\) and \\( y=-x \\), causing them to swap coordinates but not adjust signs. This directly aligns with confusing the two lines rather than generally believing reflections always swap coordinates, as the error specifically matches the \\( y=x \\) rule. Other misconceptions like reversing signs alone would produce \\(( -4,4)\\) from \\((4,4)\\), not \\((4,-4)\\).",
