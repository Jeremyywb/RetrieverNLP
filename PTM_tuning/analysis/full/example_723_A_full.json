  "explanation": "The correct solution requires finding x-values where \\(y = x^2 - x - 9\\) intersects \\(y = -6\\), achieved by solving \\(x^2 - x - 3 = 0\\). Graphically, this corresponds to identifying the parabola's intersection points with the horizontal line at \\(y = -6\\), yielding \\(x \\approx 2.2\\) and \\(x \\approx -1.2\\).\n\nThe student incorrectly answered \\(x = -9\\), which matches the y-intercept of \\(y = x^2 - x - 9\\) (where \\(y = -9\\) when \\(x = 0\\)). This suggests they confused the y-intercept's vertical coordinate (-9) as an x-value solution. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the y-intercept (a point where \\(x = 0\\)) as a root (where \\(y = 0\\)), leading them to incorrectly treat the constant term's value as an x-solution. This directly aligns with the misconception that the y-intercept is a root. \n\nThis differs from related misconceptions: the error isn't about sign alignment with the constant term (as -9 isn't a solution) or misreading axes (no evidence they confused x/y-axis labels). The answer also doesn't reference the turning point. The mismatch between y-intercept and roots is the core issue.",
