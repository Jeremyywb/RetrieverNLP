  "explanation": "The correct conversion requires dividing 62 by 100: \\( \\frac{62}{100} = \\frac{31}{50} \\). The student wrote \\( \\frac{62}{10} \\), indicating they divided by 10 instead of 100. This error stems from a misunderstanding of the fundamental relationship between percentages and fractions: percentages represent \"per hundred,\" not \"per ten.\" The student likely associated the two-digit percentage 62% with a denominator of 10 due to its two digits, conflating digit count with division magnitude. This directly aligns with the misconception of dividing by 10 to find 1%, as dividing 62 by 10 yields 6.2 (equivalent to 620%), not 62%. The error is distinct from dividing by 1000 or merely writing digits over digits, as the denominator choice reflects a specific miscalculation of the percentage base.",
