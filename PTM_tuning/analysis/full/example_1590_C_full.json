  "explanation": "The correct translation requires moving \\( +4 \\) units horizontally (right) and \\( +2 \\) units vertically (up).  \nThe student instead calculated \\( -4 \\) units horizontally (left) and \\( -2 \\) units vertically (down).  \nThe error stems from misinterpreting the sign of the directional changes: they treated the required positive horizontal and vertical shifts as negative directions.  \nThis reversal directly corresponds to confusing the standard coordinate system, where right/up are positive, with an inverted system where left/down are mistakenly assumed as the default positive directions.  \nThe error is distinct from quadrant-related confusion (which involves coordinate signs) or vector component notation issues, as the student correctly identified the magnitude of movement but inverted both axes.  \nThe flaw is isolated to direction assignment, not the magnitude or coordinate plane orientation.",
