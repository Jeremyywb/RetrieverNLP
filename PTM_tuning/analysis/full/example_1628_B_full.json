  "explanation": "The equation \\(x^2 - 3x - 6 = 2\\) requires finding x-values where \\(y = x^2 - 3x - 6\\) intersects \\(y = 2\\). The student instead identified \\(y = -6\\), which corresponds to the y-intercept of the original quadratic (the value when \\(x = 0\\)).\n\nThe error stems from interpreting the y-intercept as the solution to the equation, rather than recognizing that solutions occur at x-coordinates where the quadratic equals 2. The student misapplied the concept of intercepts to a non-interpretive case, as the equation \\(x^2 - 3x - 6 = 2\\) does not involve \\(y = 0\\) or \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThis contrasts with related errors like misreading axes or confusing x-intercepts: the answer explicitly references a y-value, confirming the focus on the y-intercept rather than misreading coordinates. The misconception directly conflates the graphical solution of an equation with the intercepts of its graph, bypassing the required equality interpretation.",
