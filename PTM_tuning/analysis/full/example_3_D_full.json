  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes that in any rectangle (including non-squares), diagonals bisect each other but are only perpendicular in squares. Since the problem specifies \"different length sides,\" the diagonals cannot form 90\u00b0 angles. \n\nThe student's answer (\"Not enough information\") suggests they either:\n1) Failed to recognize that the rectangle's side-length inequality inherently prevents perpendicular diagonals, or\n2) Thought angle measures might vary with side lengths despite the rectangle definition\n\nThe error stems from not connecting the rectangle's side-length property (adjacent sides unequal) to its diagonal angle consequences. While they might know diagonals are congruent (related to rectangle classification), they missed that unequal sides force non-right diagonal intersection angles. This differs from \"doesn't know diagonals of squares bisect at right angles\" because the student here failed to apply the inverse: non-squares (but rectangles) cannot have this property.\n\nThe misconception directly links to overlooking how quadrilateral classification (rectangle vs square) dictates specific diagonal angle properties regardless of dimensions. Related misconceptions about perpendicular definitions or side-length properties are less precise, as the core error involves conditional diagonal relationships in rectangle subcategories.",
