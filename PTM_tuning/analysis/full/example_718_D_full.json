  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes that factors of \\(12y\\) are expressions that multiply to produce \\(12y\\). Tom is correct because \\(12y \u00f7 y = 12\\), proving \\(y\\) is a factor. Katie is correct because \\(12y \u00f7 3 = 4y\\), showing 3 divides \\(12y\\). \n\nThe student likely treated \\(12y\\) as an inseparable term rather than a product \\(12 \\times y\\). This prevented them from seeing that \\(y\\) qualifies as a factor (since \\(12 \\times y\\) explicitly contains \\(y\\)) and that 3 divides the coefficient 12 (since \\(12 = 3 \\times 4\\)). \n\nTheir error stems from misinterpreting algebraic notation: they failed to recognize that \\(12y\\) inherently contains factors \\(12\\) and \\(y\\), and that numerical factors of 12 (like 3) remain valid in the algebraic context. This differs from related misconceptions about common factors, as the issue is not about shared factors but about failing to decompose the expression into its multiplicative components. The core flaw was treating \\(12y\\) as an atomic unit rather than a factored product.",
