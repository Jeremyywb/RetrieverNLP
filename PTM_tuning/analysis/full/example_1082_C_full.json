  "explanation": "The correct solution requires solving \\( x^3 = 27 \\), yielding \\( x = 3 \\), as \\( 3^3 = 27 \\). For \\( x = -3 \\), \\( (-3)^3 = -27 \\), which does not match the given \\( y \\)-value. The student likely assumed \\( (-3)^3 = 27 \\), incorrectly extending symmetry rules from even functions (e.g., \\( x^2 \\)) to the odd function \\( x^3 \\). This reflects a belief that input-output pairs for \\( x^3 \\) mirror around \\((0,0)\\), when in reality, \\( x^3 \\) maps positive \\( x \\)-values to positive \\( y \\)-values exclusively. The error is distinct from sign-related multiplication errors (e.g., miscounting negative factors) or confusion about cube definitions, as it specifically misapplies symmetry to an asymmetrical function.",
