  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n\\( s = (3 \\times 4) + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times (4^2) \\)\nFirst term: \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\)\nSecond term: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 16 = 48 \\)\nTotal: \\( 12 + 48 = 60 \\)\n\nStudent's likely error:\nThey computed the second term as \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 4\\right)^2 = 12^2 = 144 \\), then added \\( 12 + 144 = 156 \\).\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student incorrectly squared the entire product \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times t \\) instead of squaring \\( t \\) first. This indicates they treated the exponent as applying to all factors in the term rather than only the variable \\( t \\).\n\nMisconception link:\nBy prioritizing multiplication over exponentiation, they violated the order of operations. This matches the misconception where coefficients are multiplied with variables before applying exponents, rather than applying the exponent to the variable first.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike errors involving squaring coefficients separately or misplacing parentheses in sums, this error specifically stems from misapplying the exponent to the entire coefficient-variable product instead of the variable alone.",
