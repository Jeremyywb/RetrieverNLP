  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\).\n\nIncorrect calculation: The student wrote \"38,\" likely concatenating \"3\" and \"8\" as digits.\n\nThe student treated \"triple\" as a digit placement operation rather than multiplication. They placed \"3\" to the left of \"8\" (as in concatenation), producing 38. This reflects a confusion between numerical operations and digit manipulation, assuming \"triple\" requires inserting a \"3\" adjacent to the original number. \n\nThis error specifically stems from misinterpreting \"triple\" as modifying the digit string rather than performing arithmetic. It differs from adding 3 (which would yield 11) or adding 8 three times (which equals 24). The error uniquely involves disregarding place value and operation semantics, not a simple addition/multiplication swap.",
