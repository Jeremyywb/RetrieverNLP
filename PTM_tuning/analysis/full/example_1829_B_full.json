  "explanation": "Correct estimation:\n1. Round numbers to 1 significant figure: 4 (4.12), 20 (18.3), 0.2 (0.226)\n2. Calculate numerator: 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n3. Divide by denominator: 80 \u00f7 0.2 = 400\n\nStudent's error:\n4.12 \u00d7 18.3 \u00d7 0.226 \u2248 17 \u2192 rounded to 16\n\nCritical flaw:\nThe student treated the division operation as multiplication. This caused them to multiply all three numbers together (4.12\u00d718.3\u00d70.226) instead of dividing the product (4.12\u00d718.3) by 0.226.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\n- Not an order-of-operations issue: Left-to-right execution would still produce 333 with exact calculation\n- Not a rounding issue: Even with poor rounding (e.g., 4\u00d718\u00d70.2=14.4), the fundamental error remains multiplying instead of dividing\n\nThe core misconception was misinterpreting the fraction's division as multiplication, directly producing the erroneous 16 instead of 400.",
