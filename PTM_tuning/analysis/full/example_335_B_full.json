  "explanation": "Correct method:\nJo: Adding 19 = +10 +10 -1 (net +19)\nPaul: Subtracting 19 = -10 -10 +1 (net -19)\n\nStudent's error:\nBelieved 10+10-1 \u2260 +19 while accepting 10+10-1 as valid for subtraction\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student failed to recognize equivalent expressions through inverse operations. When adding 19, Jo's method adds 20 then removes 1 (x+10+10-1). The student likely treated the final subtraction as invalid in addition contexts, while accepting Paul's final addition in subtraction contexts as legitimate compensation.\n\nDemonstration:\nFor 50+19, Jo's method gives 50\u219260\u219270\u219269 (correct). The student might have incorrectly calculated this as 50\u219260\u219259\u219269 through misordered operations, or rejected the subtraction step's validity in an addition task.\n\nDistinction:\nThis differs from \"adds rather than subtracts\" errors because the student correctly handled Paul's mixed operations but rejected Jo's equivalent mixed operations, showing selective acceptance of inverse compensation.\n\nKey issue:\nThe student maintained rigid separation between addition/subtraction operations rather than recognizing them as inverse tools for equivalent results.",
