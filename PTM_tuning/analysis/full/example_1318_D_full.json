  "explanation": "To determine the correct box for 30:\n1. Check if 30 is a factor of 60: \\(60 \\div 30 = 2\\), confirming it is a factor.\n2. Check if 30 is a multiple of 4: \\(30 \\div 4 = 7.5\\), showing it is not.\n\nThe student incorrectly concluded 30 is not a factor of 60. This suggests they failed to recognize that 30 (composed of prime factors \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)) divides 60 (\\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)) because all prime factors of 30 are present in 60. This aligns with the misconception about products of primes not being recognized as factors. The error is distinct from misunderstandings about multiples or self-multiples, as the student correctly identified 30 isn't a multiple of 4 but misapplied factor relationships.",
