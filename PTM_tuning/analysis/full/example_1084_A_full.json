  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n876,099 - 100 = 875,999  \nSubtracting 100 requires decreasing the hundreds place by 1 (876,099 \u2192 875,999).\n\nStudent's error:  \nWrote 876.099, treating the original number's comma as a decimal point. This converts 876,099 to 876.099 (\u00f71000), not 875,999 (-100).\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student misinterpreted the comma in 876,099 as a decimal separator rather than a thousands separator. This caused them to represent the number as 876.099 (equivalent to 876,099 \u00f7 1000) instead of performing subtraction.\n\nConnection to misconception:  \nThe error directly stems from misplacing the decimal point due to confusion about numerical notation conventions. The student failed to recognize that commas in large numbers separate thousands, not decimals, leading to a value 1000\u00d7 smaller rather than 100 less.\n\nDistinction:  \nThis differs from \"subtracts instead of divides\" because the student didn't attempt an incorrect operation \u2013 they misread the number's structure. It also isn't about decimal magnitude (since 876.099 is smaller, not larger) or zero-dropping in place values.\n\nFinal analysis:  \nMisidentifying the comma as a decimal point invalidated the entire calculation, replacing subtraction with an unintended scaling error tied to place-value notation.",
