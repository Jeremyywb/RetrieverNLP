  "explanation": "The correct calculation treats the denominator as a single entity: \\( 2 \\div (3 + ab) = \\frac{2}{ab + 3} \\).  \nThe student incorrectly split the expression into \\( \\frac{2}{3} + ab \\), treating the division as applying only to the \"3\" rather than the entire \"3 + ab\".  \nThis error stems from misinterpreting the fraction's denominator: the student failed to recognize that the division operator requires grouping the entire sum \\( (3 + ab) \\) as the denominator.  \nThe misconception directly aligns with misunderstanding fraction grouping, as they prioritized separating terms instead of maintaining the denominator's integrity.  \nThis differs from general order-of-operations errors, as the student specifically neglected the implied grouping by the division symbol, not merely miscalculating operations within the denominator.  \nThe error shows a failure to apply division to the grouped expression, not a left-to-right execution or isolated priority mistake.",
