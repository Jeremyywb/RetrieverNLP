  "explanation": "The correct solution recognizes that in a rhombus, the diagonals \\( AC \\) and \\( DB \\) are always perpendicular. The student's answer (\"None of them\") suggests they failed to apply this property. \n\nA key step in solving the problem is identifying that diagonals in a rhombus bisect each other at 90\u00b0. The student likely dismissed perpendicularity because they conflated the rhombus's general lack of right angles (in its sides) with the diagonals' behavior. This error stems from not distinguishing between angle properties of the shape itself and the angle relationships between its diagonals. \n\nThe primary misconception (parallelograms can't have right angles) manifests here as an assumption that no lines in the rhombus \u2013 including diagonals \u2013 could be perpendicular, despite the diagonals' unique property. This differs from related misconceptions like confusing \"perpendicular\" with \"parallel,\" which would produce an incorrect pair selection rather than a blanket rejection of perpendicularity.",
