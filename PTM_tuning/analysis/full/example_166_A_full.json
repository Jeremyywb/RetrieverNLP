  "explanation": "The correct calculation proceeds as:\n\\[\n\\frac{x-1}{6} \\times \\frac{9}{x^{2}-1} = \\frac{x-1}{6} \\times \\frac{9}{(x+1)(x-1)}\n\\]\nby factoring \\(x^2-1\\). The student's incorrect answer \\(\\frac{9x-1}{6x^{2}-1}\\) suggests they attempted to multiply numerators and denominators directly but misapplied distribution: \\((x-1) \\times 9\\) became \\(9x-1\\) (instead of \\(9x-9\\)) and \\(6 \\times (x^2-1)\\) became \\(6x^2-1\\) (instead of \\(6x^2-6\\)). \n\nThe flaw lies in treating the terms \\(x-1\\) and \\(x^2-1\\) as single units rather than expressions requiring full distribution. The student multiplied only the first term of each binomial (\\(x\\) in \\(x-1\\), \\(x^2\\) in \\(x^2-1\\)) by the coefficients 9 and 6, respectively, while leaving the second term (\\(-1\\)) unchanged. This reflects a failure to apply the distributive property to both terms in the multiplication. \n\nThis error is distinct from related misconceptions like not factoring \\(x^2-1\\) or misapplying division rules, as the reciprocal step was correctly performed, and the mistake occurred during multiplication.",
