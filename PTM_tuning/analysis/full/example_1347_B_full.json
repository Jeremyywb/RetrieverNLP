  "explanation": "To calculate the mean age, the third column should contain \"Age \u00d7 Frequency\" to compute each age group's total years (18\u00d77, 19\u00d73, etc.), which are summed and divided by total frequency. The student wrote \"Age - Frequency,\" implying entries like 18-7 or 7-18. This indicates they misinterpreted the required operation for aggregating data, replacing multiplication with subtraction. The error stems from conflating arithmetic operations in tabular calculations, specifically using subtraction where multiplicative combination is necessary to compute weighted totals. This aligns with misapplying subtraction instead of multiplication for grouped data aggregation, distinct from later errors like substituting division for subtraction in averaging steps. The mistake occurs at the foundational step of defining column operations, not in subsequent arithmetic or formula application.",
