  "explanation": "The correct calculation: \\(609 \\div 1000 = 0.609\\) (decimal moved three places left: \\(609 \\rightarrow 60.9 \\rightarrow 6.09 \\rightarrow 0.609\\)).\n\nThe student's calculation: They likely moved the decimal point only two places left (\\(609 \\rightarrow 60.9 \\rightarrow 6.09\\)), yielding \\(6.09\\).\n\nThe error stems from misapplying the divisor's magnitude. The student treated 1000 as equivalent to 100 (two decimal shifts) instead of three. This reflects a failure to match decimal movement to the divisor's power of 10, specifically undercounting the required shifts by one. \n\nThis aligns with a misconception of producing answers 10 times larger than correct, as stopping at two shifts divides by 100 instead of 1000. It differs from confusing place values (e.g., hundreds vs thousands) or dividing by 10 once instead of multiple times, as the error directly correlates to an incorrect count of decimal shifts relative to the divisor's zeros.",
