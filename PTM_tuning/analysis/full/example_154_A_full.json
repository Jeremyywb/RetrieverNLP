  "explanation": "The correct calculation determines the time axis scale using the given speed: total time = 60m / 4m/s = 15s. Three squares span 15s, so each square = 5s. The marked point at one square gives t=5s, hence (5,40). \n\nThe student likely counted squares directly as seconds, assuming 1 square = 1s, leading to (1,40). This error stems from misinterpreting the unlabeled axis scale, treating grid units as equal to numerical values without calibration. The misconception directly caused the error because the student failed to calculate the actual time per square using the speed and total displacement. \n\nThis differs from related misconceptions like reading the wrong axis (they correctly associated distance with 40m) or counting points (they mapped squares to time correctly, but with incorrect scaling). The flaw is strictly in assuming grid squares correspond 1:1 to units without deriving the true scale.",
