  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Gradient = (2-0)/(1-0) = 2  \nStudent's answer: Wrote \"2x\" instead of 2  \n\nThe student likely recognized the line's equation as y=2x through the points (0,0) and (1,2), but mistakenly equated the entire \"2x\" term with the gradient rather than isolating the coefficient. This reflects confusion between the slope value (a scalar) and its role as a coefficient in the linear equation. While they correctly identified the relationship between x and y in the equation, they failed to distinguish the numerical slope from the variable term it multiplies. This error specifically stems from conflating slope representation in equations with the gradient's definition as a numerical value, rather than a misunderstanding of slope calculation methods or non-standard equation forms. Related misconceptions about multiplying coordinate changes or handling non y=mx+c forms don't apply here, as the student's error occurred after correctly determining the equation's form.",
