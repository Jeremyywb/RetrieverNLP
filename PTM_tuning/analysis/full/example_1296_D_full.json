  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8 \\)\nStudent's calculation: Likely interpreted \"cube\" as \\( 1 \\times 3 = 3 \\), treating the operation as multiplication by 3 instead of threefold multiplication\n\nThe error stems from interpreting \"cubing\" as multiplying a base number by 3 rather than multiplying the number by itself twice. This caused the student to calculate \\( 1 \\times 3 = 3 \\) instead of \\( 2^3 \\). The misconception directly substitutes exponentiation with scalar multiplication by 3, altering the mathematical structure of the operation.\n\nThis flaw distinguishes from \"multiples of 3\" (which would involve 6, 9, etc.) and \"adding 3\" (which would yield 4 for \\( 1+3 \\)). The error specifically replaces the exponential operation with multiplication by 3, not merely associating cube numbers with the number 3 itself.",
