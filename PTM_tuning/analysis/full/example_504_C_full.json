  "explanation": "The correct equation uses factors corresponding to the x-intercepts: \\( (x + 3)(x + 1) \\), yielding roots at \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\). The student wrote \\( (x + 1)(x - 3) \\), producing roots at \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\). \n\nThe error occurs in translating the intercept \\( x = -3 \\) into the factor: the student incorrectly used \\( (x - 3) \\) instead of \\( (x + 3) \\). This reflects a sign reversal in one factor despite correctly identifying the intercept values. The misconception involves misapplying the relationship between roots and factors: the factor should be \\( (x - \\text{root}) \\), but the student treated the root\u2019s numerical value as having the opposite sign. \n\nThis flaw directly aligns with swapping signs in factors while retaining the correct root magnitudes, not arithmetic errors or misreading intercept locations. The y-intercept calculation (which would fail for \\( (x - 3) \\)) is unaffected here, ruling out other misconceptions like sign confusion in multiplication.",
