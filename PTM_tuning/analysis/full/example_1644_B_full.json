  "explanation": "The correct solution uses similar triangles: The ratio of the bases (5cm:15cm = 1:3) equals the ratio of corresponding sides. Let the entire vertical side be \\( x + y \\). Then \\( \\frac{x}{x+y} = \\frac{1}{3} \\), leading to \\( x:y = 1:2 \\).\n\nThe student likely calculated \\( 5:15 = 1:3 \\), then directly mapped this to \\( x:y \\) as 1:3. This treats the ratio of one part to the whole (1:3) as the ratio between two parts (x:y), ignoring that \\( y = (x+y) - x = 3x - x = 2x \\).\n\nThe error stems from conflating part-to-whole relationships with part-to-part relationships. The student used the ratio between x and the total side length (\\( x+y \\)) as if it were the ratio between x and y, rather than solving for their proportional relationship.\n\nThis matches the primary misconception of \"mixes up total and part in ratio\" because the student treated the 1:3 ratio (part:whole) as equivalent to 1:3 (part:part). It's distinct from \"thinks ratios are written as 1:total\" because the error isn't formatting-related but conceptual confusion about what quantities are being compared.\n\nThe key misstep was failing to recognize that \\( x \\) corresponds to 1 portion and \\( y \\) corresponds to 2 portions of the divided side once the total ratio is established.",
