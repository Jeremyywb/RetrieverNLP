  "explanation": "The correct simplification requires dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). For \\( \\frac{9}{12} \\), GCD(9,12) = 3:  \n\\( \\frac{9 \\div 3}{12 \\div 3} = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nThe student left the fraction unchanged as \\( \\frac{9}{12} \\), indicating no division was attempted. This suggests they believed the fraction was already in simplest form. The error stems from misidentifying 9 as a prime number (it is not, since \\( 9 = 3 \\times 3 \\)), leading them to incorrectly assume no common factors existed. This matches the misconception that fractions with (perceived) prime numerators cannot be simplified. \n\nDistinct from \"forgot to simplify,\" the student actively judged the fraction as irreducible. Unlike \"does not understand how to simplify,\" the error here is rooted in flawed identification of primes, not procedural knowledge of division.",
