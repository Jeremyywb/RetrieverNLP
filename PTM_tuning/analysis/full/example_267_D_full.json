  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( (5^4)^3 = 5^{4 \\times 3} = 5^{12} \\).\n\nIncorrect approach: A student might calculate \\( 5^4 = 625 \\), then multiply by 3: \\( 625 \\times 3 = 1875 \\), concluding the answer isn't among the options. \n\nThe error stems from treating the outer exponent (3) as a multiplicative factor instead of applying the power-of-a-power rule. The student misapplied the exponent's role by performing \\( (5^4) \\times 3 \\) rather than \\( 5^{4 \\times 3} \\). This conflates exponentiation with scalar multiplication, directly aligning with the \"multiplies by the index\" misconception.\n\nThis differs from adding exponents (which would yield \\( 5^7 \\)) or multiplying bases (e.g., \\( 15^4 \\)). The error is uniquely tied to misinterpreting the exponent's function as a multiplier rather than a repeated power.",
