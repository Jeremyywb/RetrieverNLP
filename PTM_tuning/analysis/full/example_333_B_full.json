  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 0.26 - 0.6 = -(0.6 - 0.26) = -0.34 \\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\( 0.6 - 0.26 = 0.34 \\) (without applying the negative sign).  \n\nThe student treated \\( 0.26 - 0.6 \\) as \\( 0.6 - 0.26 \\), correctly computing \\( 0.34 \\) but failing to recognize the need for a negative result. This shows they understood the mechanics of decimal subtraction but didn't account for the order of terms. The error stems from not conceptualizing that \\( a - b \\) yields a negative value when \\( b > a \\).  \n\nThis differs from place-value errors (which would produce incorrect digits) or sign-ignoring (which would preserve the original numbers' signs). The student actively reversed the terms to avoid negative results, aligning with the primary misconception.",
