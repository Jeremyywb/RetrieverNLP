  "explanation": "To eliminate \\( q \\) in Pair 1 (\\( 2p -4q=6 \\), \\( 7p +4q=9 \\)), adding the equations cancels \\(-4q\\) and \\(+4q\\). For Pair 2 (\\( 2p -4q=6 \\), \\( 7p -4q=9 \\)), subtracting the equations eliminates \\(-4q - (-4q)\\). \n\nThe student added both pairs:  \nPair 2 addition yields \\( 9p -8q=15 \\), retaining \\( q \\).  \n\nThe error stems from assuming identical coefficients (both \\(-4q\\)) can be eliminated by addition. When matching terms have identical signs, subtraction is required to cancel them. The student incorrectly applied addition despite matching signs, conflating the condition for elimination (coefficient magnitude) with the necessary operation (subtraction for same-signed terms). This differs from errors involving opposite signs or misapplying operations based on term positions.",
