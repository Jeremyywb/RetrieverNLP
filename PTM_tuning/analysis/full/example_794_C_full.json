  "explanation": "The correct approach recognizes probabilities must sum to 1, but requires knowing all categories: \\( P(\\text{strawberry}) + P(\\text{orange}) + P(\\text{blackcurrant}) = 1 \\). The student incorrectly calculated \\( 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 \\), treating \"not strawberry\" as a single category. \n\nThis error occurred because they conflated the combined probability of orange and blackcurrant sweets (which equals 0.2) with the specific probability of orange sweets alone. They assumed all non-strawberry outcomes were orange, neglecting the blackcurrant category entirely. \n\nThe primary misconception manifests in treating \"not strawberry\" as equivalent to \"orange\" rather than recognizing it contains multiple distinct outcomes. This differs from general \"failure to consider all outcomes\" because it specifically misattributes the complement set's probability to a single subcategory rather than distributing it across multiple possible subcategories.",
