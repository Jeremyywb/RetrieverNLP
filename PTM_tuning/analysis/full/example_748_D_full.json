  "explanation": "A hexagonal prism requires two hexagonal bases (6-sided) connected by 6 rectangular faces, matching the number of sides in the base. The student selected a shape with 8 rectangular faces and octagonal bases, implying they counted the rectangular faces (8) and used that number to name the base (octagon) rather than recognizing the base's polygon dictates the rectangle count. This shows they reversed the causal relationship: instead of deriving lateral faces from the base's sides, they derived the base's name from the lateral face count. The error directly aligns with misunderstanding prisms are defined by their base shape, not lateral face quantity. This is distinct from confusing specific polygon names (e.g., octagon vs. pentagon) or misidentifying pyramid structures, as the core flaw lies in the prism\u2019s structural definition.",
