  "explanation": "The problem requires finding numbers that divide 60 exactly to create equal classes. The correct answer involves identifying factors (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) that split 60 into whole-number groups. \n\nThe student's answer \"fractions\" suggests they interpreted \"split\" as requiring parts of a whole (e.g., \u00bd, \u00bc), which are divisions resulting in non-integer values. This conflates the concept of division with fractional results and misunderstands the requirement for equal whole-number groupings. \n\nThe error stems from confusing the term \"factor\" (whole divisors) with \"fractions\" (partial divisions), misapplying the concept of splitting into parts rather than equal integer quantities. This aligns with a misunderstanding of \"factor\" terminology, not errors in calculating factor pairs or multiples. The distinction lies in the student's focus on division outcomes rather than identifying exact divisors.",
