  "explanation": "Correct combination:\n24 (whole number sum) + 1.3 (decimal sum) = 25.3\n\nStudent's error:\n24 + 1.3 = 24.13\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student treated the decimal sum 1.3 as a separate entity to append to 24's decimal place rather than adding it as a value. They misinterpreted the \"+\" operation between whole and decimal parts as concatenation (writing 1.3 after 24's decimal point) instead of arithmetic addition. This stems from viewing decimal components as fixed positional digits rather than quantities requiring proper place value integration.\n\nDistinction: Unlike column addition errors (where carrying is mishandled within digits), this error occurs when combining pre-calculated whole and decimal sums. The student didn't recognize that 1.3 must increase the whole number portion by 1, keeping 0.3 in the decimal place.\n\nThe misconception aligns with treating decimal operations as separate whole/decimal manipulations without synthesizing their combined value, rather than a failure to carry within traditional vertical addition steps.",
