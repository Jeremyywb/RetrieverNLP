  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nThe compound shape's horizontal sides must sum consistently. The left rectangle's horizontal side is 12 cm. The right rectangle's horizontal side (p) and adjacent 7 cm segment must together equal 12 cm for alignment. Thus, p = 12 cm - 7 cm = 5 cm.\n\nStudent's Likely Calculation:\nThe student directly equated p to the visible 7 cm segment labeled on the right rectangle, assuming p matches this labeled length without considering how adjacent sides relate.\n\nReasoning Flaw:\nThe student failed to recognize that horizontal sides in the compound structure must maintain equal total lengths across the figure. By isolating the 7 cm segment rather than seeing it as part of a larger 12 cm side requiring subtraction, they treated the measurement as standalone.\n\nConnection to Misconception:\nThis reflects a failure to use rectangle properties (opposite sides equal) to derive missing lengths through additive/subtractive relationships in composite shapes. The error stems from analyzing segments in isolation rather than systemically.\n\nDistinction from Related Errors:\nUnlike perimeter misconceptions, the error specifically involves missing additive relationships between adjacent sides. The student correctly avoided assuming all sides are equal (square misconception) but misapplied how labeled segments interact spatially.",
