  "explanation": "The correct volume calculation requires cubing the edge length: \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\). The student's claim of \"not enough information\" suggests they may have treated the shape as a cuboid requiring separate length/width/height measurements rather than recognizing that all edges in a cube are equal. This directly stems from misapplying cuboid reasoning to a cube, as they failed to infer that the labeled edge defines all dimensions. The error is distinct from volume unit confusion (they didn't miscalculate exponents) or cube number misunderstanding (they never attempted computation). Their core issue was structural misidentification of the shape's properties.",
