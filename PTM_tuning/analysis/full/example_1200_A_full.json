  "explanation": "The correct denominator is calculated by considering all possible ways to choose 3 balls from 9: \\(9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 504\\). The student likely computed \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\\), using the number of yellow balls (4) instead of the total balls (9) when calculating permutations. \n\nThis error stems from treating the yellow balls as the total pool rather than the full set of 9 balls. The student incorrectly focused on a subset (yellow balls) for the denominator instead of the entire collection. This aligns with the misconception of using a single criterion's total (yellow balls) rather than the overall total. \n\nIt differs from replacement-related misconceptions because the error isn\u2019t about maintaining a denominator of 9 across picks but entirely misidentifying which total to use. The student\u2019s 24 directly reflects permutations of 4 items, not an incorrect application of sequential probability.",
