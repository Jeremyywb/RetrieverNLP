  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nSubstitute \\( k=8 \\) into \\( 2j - k = -10 \\):\n\\( 2j - 8 = -10 \\)\nAdd 8 to both sides:\n\\( 2j = -10 + 8 \\)\n\\( 2j = -2 \\)\nDivide by 2:\n\\( j = -1 \\)\n\nStudent's likely steps:\nSubstituted \\( k=8 \\):\n\\( 2j - 8 = -10 \\)\nAttempted to isolate \\( 2j \\) by subtracting 8 instead of adding:\n\\( 2j = -10 - 8 \\)\n\\( 2j = -18 \\)\nDivided by 2 but ignored the negative sign:\n\\( j = 9 \\)\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student incorrectly subtracted 8 from both sides instead of adding it, then disregarded the negative sign during division. This reflects a failure to apply inverse operations properly when isolating variables and mishandling signed values during division. \n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThe error stems from flawed algebraic manipulation, not substitution errors or misapplying operations across equations. While sign handling was involved, the core issue was misapplying inverse operations rather than misinterpreting negative signs during subtraction of terms.",
