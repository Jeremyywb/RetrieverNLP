  "explanation": "Correct solution:\n1. Start with output: 8\n2. Reverse last operation (\u00d72 becomes \u00f72): 8 \u00f7 2 = 4\n3. Reverse first operation (-1 becomes +1): 4 + 1 = 5\n\nStudent's incorrect steps:\n1. Started with output: 8\n2. Added 1 first (incorrect order): 8 + 1 = 9\n3. Then divided by 2: 9 \u00f7 2 = 4.5\n\nSpecific flaw: The student correctly identified the inverse operations (addition for subtraction, division for multiplication) but applied them in the original left-to-right sequence of the function machine rather than reversing the order. This caused them to execute +1 before \u00f72 instead of after.\n\nConnection to misconception: This directly matches the error pattern of reversing operation types but maintaining their original sequence, rather than reversing both the operations and their order. The student addressed \"what to do\" (use inverses) but not \"when to do it\" (reverse execution order).\n\nDistinction: This differs from simply using the same operations (which would yield 7\u00d72=14) or partial calculations. The critical error was order preservation, not operation selection.",
