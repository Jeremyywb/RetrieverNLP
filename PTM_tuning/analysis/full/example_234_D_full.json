  "explanation": "To find the range (max - min), one must identify the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. Sorting is not strictly required, as these extremes can be found without ordering the data. \n\nThe student incorrectly assumed sorting is \"never needed,\" likely because they conflated range with interquartile range (IQR). IQR requires sorting to determine quartiles, leading them to mistakenly reject sorting as irrelevant to range calculations. \n\nThis directly stems from confusing the requirements of two different statistical measures. However, sorting can still be a valid (albeit optional) step to simplify finding extremes. The error isn't about misidentifying extremes or confusing range with mode, but specifically misattributing IQR-related steps to range calculations.",
