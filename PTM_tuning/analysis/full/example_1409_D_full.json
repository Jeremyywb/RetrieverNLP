  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes the ratio 1:4 means Isaac has \\( \\frac{4}{1} = 4 \\) times as many biscuits as Kate. \n\nThe student likely subtracted the ratio terms: \\( 4 - 1 = 3 \\), assuming the difference represents the multiplicative relationship. \n\nThis error stems from misinterpreting the ratio as indicating a difference-based comparison rather than a direct division of parts. The student treated the ratio terms as absolute quantities to be subtracted, not as relative measures requiring division. \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of using the difference between ratio terms instead of their quotient. It differs from part-to-whole confusion, as the question explicitly compares one part (Isaac) to another (Kate), not parts to a total. The error is specifically about misapplying subtraction in a multiplicative context, not about fraction denominators or ratio simplification.",
