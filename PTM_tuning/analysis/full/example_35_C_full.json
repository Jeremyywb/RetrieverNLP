  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n0.6 \u00d7 100 = 60 \u2192 60%  \n\nStudent's calculation:  \n0.6 \u2192 0.6%  \n\nThe student treated the decimal as a completed percentage by directly appending the % symbol without performing multiplication by 100. This reflects a belief that percentages are created solely by adding notation rather than scaling the value to represent parts per hundred. The error stems from conflating the act of labeling with the mathematical conversion process.  \n\nThis differs from dividing by 100 (which would produce 0.006%) or decimal misplacement (which might yield 6% or 600%). The answer specifically matches the pattern of treating the original decimal as a valid percentage through symbol addition alone.",
