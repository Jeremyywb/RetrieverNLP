  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Total parts = 3 + 5 = 8. Each part = 48 \u00f7 8 = 6. AN = 3 parts = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 m.\n\nStudent's error: Student calculated 48 \u00f7 8 = 6 but then treated this as the final answer for AN instead of multiplying by 3.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student correctly found the value per ratio part (6) but stopped there, failing to scale the ratio term (3) by this per-part value. This indicates they conflated the per-part quantity with the actual segment length rather than recognizing the need to distribute the total proportionally across all parts.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike dividing by individual ratio terms (e.g., 48 \u00f7 3), the student properly divided by the sum of the ratio parts. The error stems from misapplying the ratio after calculating the per-part value, not from miscomputing the initial division.",
