  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 30\\, \\text{cl} \\times \\frac{1\\, \\text{L}}{100\\, \\text{cl}} = 0.3\\, \\text{L} \\).\n\nStudent's likely calculation: \\( 30 \\times 0.1 = 3\\, \\text{L} \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly multiplied by \\( 0.1 \\) (equivalent to dividing by \\( 10 \\)) instead of dividing by \\( 100 \\). This reflects a misunderstanding of the centi- prefix's magnitude (\\( 10^{-2} \\)), leading them to use a \\( 10^{-1} \\) scaling factor when converting to liters. \n\nThis error specifically stems from reversing the scaling direction required for unit conversion to a larger measurement (where division is needed), mistakenly applying multiplication instead. It differs from \"adds an extra zero\" (which would require digit manipulation errors) and \"confuses cl and ml\" (which would produce \\( 0.03\\, \\text{L} \\) if confused with milliliters).",
