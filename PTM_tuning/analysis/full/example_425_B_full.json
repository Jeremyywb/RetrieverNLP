  "explanation": "To simplify \\( \\frac{18}{30} \\), the GCD of 18 and 30 is 6. Correct simplification: \\( \\frac{18 \\div 6}{30 \\div 6} = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\nThe student divided numerator and denominator by 2 instead: \\( \\frac{18 \\div 2}{30 \\div 2} = \\frac{9}{15} \\).\n\nThe error occurred because the student identified 2 as a common factor but failed to recognize 6 as the higher common factor. This caused partial simplification rather than full reduction. \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of stopping at a suboptimal divisor (2) instead of iterating to the GCD (6). It differs from \"forgot to simplify\" (as partial simplification occurred) and unrelated to adding/subtracting errors. The core flaw was prioritizing an intermediate factor over the maximal one.",
