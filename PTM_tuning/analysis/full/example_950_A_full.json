  "explanation": "The correct answer \\( \\sqrt{49} = 7 \\) is rational, making it not a surd. The student incorrectly identified \\( \\sqrt{45} \\) (which simplifies to \\( 3\\sqrt{5} \\), an irrational number) as not a surd. \n\nThe student likely failed to recognize that a surd must result in an irrational number. They might have confused partial simplification (e.g., \\( \\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5} \\)) with rationalization, not realizing that any remaining irrational component still qualifies it as a surd. This directly stems from misunderstanding that only roots of non-square numbers are surds, regardless of partial factoring. \n\nThis error aligns with the misconception about recognizing perfect squares, as the student neglected to verify \\( \\sqrt{49} \\) is a perfect square. However, it differs from related misconceptions like assuming all roots are surds, since the student specifically misapplied simplification steps instead of generalizing blindly.",
