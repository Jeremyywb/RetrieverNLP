  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes the horizontal line \\( y = 2 \\) and vertical y-axis \\( x = 0 \\) intersect at 90\u00b0, making them perpendicular. \n\nThe student's answer (\"opposite\") likely stems from conflating directional terms. They observed the horizontal line runs left-right while the y-axis runs vertical, interpreting these directions as \"opposite\" rather than mathematically perpendicular. \n\nThis error directly connects to confusing the x and y axes: if the student misattributes the horizontal line's relationship to the y-axis (e.g., viewing horizontal as \"opposite\" to vertical due to axis misidentification), they bypass the precise geometric term \"perpendicular.\" \n\nThe error is distinct from not knowing \"parallel\" (which would yield \"parallel\" as an answer) or misjudging parallelism, as the line is clearly horizontal and not parallel to the vertical y-axis.",
