  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 598 - 1000 = -(1000 - 598) = -402  \nIncorrect reasoning: The student likely concluded 598 < 1000 makes standard subtraction impossible, without applying negative number concepts.  \n\nThe student failed to recognize that when the minuend is smaller, subtraction yields a negative value through the relationship a - b = -(b - a). They treated subtraction as exclusively producing positive results, halting at the inequality rather than applying integer operations.  \n\nThis directly stems from not understanding negative numbers as valid outputs of subtraction. While related misconceptions involve borrowing procedures, the student's answer shows no attempt to perform digit-by-digit calculations - they rejected the operation entirely rather than struggling with regrouping. The error stems purely from rejecting negative results, not from technical execution of arithmetic steps.",
