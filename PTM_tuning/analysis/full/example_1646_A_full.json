  "explanation": "The correct proof sums the angles around the point:  \n\\( (m+50) + (2m+n) + (220-2m) = 360 \\) \u2192 \\( m + n + 270 = 360 \\) \u2192 \\( m + n = 90 \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly concluded \\( m = n \\). This occurred because they likely equated the algebraic expressions for angles that appeared visually similar in the diagram (e.g., interpreting \\( 2m+n \\) and \\( 220-2m \\) as equal due to perceived symmetry). By assuming equal angles imply equal variables, they conflated visual appearance with algebraic relationships.  \n\nThis error aligns with attributing equality to diagrammatic similarity rather than mathematical constraints. It differs from misconceptions about angle sums (which the student ignored) or vertical angles (not applicable here since no intersecting lines are specified). The core flaw was prioritizing visual cues over systematic calculation of angle relationships.",
