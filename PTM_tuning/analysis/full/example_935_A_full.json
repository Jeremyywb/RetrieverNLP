  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n2j - k = -10  \nSubstitute k=8:  \n2j - 8 = -10  \nAdd 8 to both sides:  \n2j = -10 + 8  \n2j = -2  \nDivide by 2:  \nj = -1  \n\nStudent's likely steps:\n2j - 8 = -10  \nAdd 8 to both sides:  \n2j = -10 + 8  \nMiscalculates as:  \n2j = 2  \nDivide by 2:  \nj = 1  \n\nThe error occurred when adding 8 to -10. The student incorrectly treated this as 10 - 8 = 2 instead of recognizing that -10 + 8 = -2. This shows a failure to apply sign rules when combining numbers with opposite signs, specifically misinterpreting the addition of a positive to a negative number as subtraction in reverse order.  \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of not recognizing that subtracting a larger magnitude number (10) from a smaller one (8) yields a negative result. The error is distinct from multiplication/division sign errors or substitution errors, as the flawed reasoning occurs specifically in handling additive inverses.",
