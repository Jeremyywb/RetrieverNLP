  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nh(j+2) = 10\u00d7(4+2) = 60\nh(2+j) = 10\u00d7(2+4) = 60\n\nStudent's incorrect calculations:\n1. 10\u00d7(4+2) \u2192 treated as 4\u00d7(4+2) = 24\n2. 10\u00d7(2+4) \u2192 treated as 10\u00d74 + 2 = 42\n\nSpecific flaw: The student inconsistently substituted variables. In the first expression, they replaced h with j (using 4 instead of 10), then in the second expression, they abandoned substitution but misapplied order of operations by calculating 10\u00d74 before adding 2. This dual error pattern shows variable confusion rather than pure operational priority issues. The key divergence occurred at variable identity recognition in the first equation and operational sequence in the second.\n\nDistinction: While order of operations errors could explain the second mistake alone, the substitution error in the first equation (where parentheses were correctly handled but variables mismatched) better aligns with substitution issues than bracket neglect or operational priority fallacies.",
