  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nNumerator: 6p - 9 = 3(2p - 3)\nDenominator: 6p - 3 = 3(2p - 1)\nSimplified: \\(\\frac{3(2p - 3)}{3(2p - 1)} = \\frac{2p - 3}{2p - 1}\\)\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\nThey likely divided numerator and denominator terms by 6 instead of factoring:\nNumerator: \\( \\frac{6p}{6} - \\frac{9}{6} = p - 1.5 \\) (incorrectly treated as \\(p - 3\\))\nDenominator: \\( \\frac{6p}{6} - \\frac{3}{6} = p - 0.5 \\) (incorrectly treated as \\(p - 1\\))\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nThe student incorrectly assumed 6 was a common factor of all terms in both numerator and denominator, despite 9 and 3 not being divisible by 6. This led them to divide each term by 6 but mishandle the constant terms, rounding \\(-9/6 = -1.5\\) to \\(-3\\) and \\(-3/6 = -0.5\\) to \\(-1\\).\n\nConnection to Misconception:\nThis error directly stems from assuming a higher coefficient (6) was a valid common factor for all terms, even when the constants didn't support it. The student prioritized the coefficient of \\(p\\) over verifying divisibility of all terms.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nUnlike errors involving letter factors or term-wise cancellation, this mistake specifically involves misidentifying a numerical coefficient as a common factor. It differs from \"only looks for number factors\" because the student focused on the coefficient of \\(p\\), not purely numerical factors.",
