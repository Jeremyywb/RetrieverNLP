  "explanation": "The correct volume calculation requires multiplying the area of the triangular face (cross-section) by the prism's length. The student instead selected a rectangular face, likely calculating \"base area \u00d7 height\" using the rectangle's dimensions. \n\nThe error stems from misidentifying the cross-sectional face. The student treated the prism as if its volume depends on a rectangular base (like a rectangular prism), confusing which dimension represents the prism's \"length.\" This aligns with failing to recognize that prisms have uniform cross-sections perpendicular to their length. \n\nThe mistake differs from surface area confusion (the question explicitly mentions volume) or pyramid-prism confusion (the shape is stated as a prism). The core issue is specifically misapplying the cross-sectional area concept to the wrong face.",
