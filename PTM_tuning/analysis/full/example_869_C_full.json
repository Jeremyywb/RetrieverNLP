  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n(2\u00d75 + 3\u00d78 + 4\u00d79 + 5\u00d75 + 6\u00d73) \u00f7 (5+8+9+5+3) = 113 \u00f7 30 \u2248 3.77\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n(5+8+9+5+3) \u00f7 (2+3+4+5+6) = 30 \u00f7 20 = 1.50\n\nThe student divided total frequency by the sum of shoe sizes instead of dividing the total product (\u03a3f\u00d7s) by total frequency. This reverses the required numerator and denominator in the mean formula, treating frequency as the data values and shoe sizes as weights. This directly stems from misunderstanding how to structure the weighted average in frequency tables. \n\nThe error differs from subtracting instead of multiplying (which would produce negative values) or counting rows for total frequency (which would yield 5 instead of 30). It specifically reflects a fundamental misapplication of the mean formula for grouped data.",
