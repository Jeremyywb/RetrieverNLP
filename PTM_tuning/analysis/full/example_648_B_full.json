  "explanation": "The correct expansion uses the binomial formula:  \n\\((3y-4)^2 = (3y)^2 + 2(3y)(-4) + (-4)^2 = 9y^2 -24y +16\\).  \n\nThe student computed:  \n\\((3y)^2 = 9y^2\\) and \\((-4)^2 = 16\\), but omitted the middle term \\(-24y\\).  \n\nThe error stems from treating the squared binomial as a simple sum of squared terms rather than applying the distributive property fully. The student neglected to multiply the cross-terms \\(3y \\times -4\\) and \\(-4 \\times 3y\\), which generate the \\(-24y\\) term.  \n\nThis aligns with a failure to recognize that squaring a binomial requires three distinct products (first\u00d7first, first\u00d7second, second\u00d7second), not just squaring individual terms.  \n\nIt differs from related misconceptions about coefficient handling: the student correctly squared \\(3y\\) (showing they didn't ignore coefficients entirely) but omitted the entire cross-term, not just miscalculating its coefficient.",
