  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n5 kg = 5 \u00f7 1000 = 0.005 t\n7 g = 7 \u00f7 (1000\u00d71000) = 0.000007 t\nTotal: 0.005 + 0.000007 = 0.005007 t\n\nStudent's calculation:\n5 kg = 0.05 t (dividing by 100 instead of 1000)\n7 g = 0.00007 t (unknown error in decimal placement)\nTotal: 0.05 + 0.00007 = 0.05007 t\n\nThe student incorrectly converted kilograms to tonnes by moving the decimal point two places (\u00f7100) instead of three. This added an extra zero in the hundredths place, making 5 kg appear as 0.05 t instead of 0.005 t. The error directly stems from misapplying decimal shifts during unit conversion, not from misinterpreting grams/kilograms relationships or multiplication errors. While the grams conversion also shows a minor discrepancy, the dominant flaw is the tenfold error in the kilogram portion, distinct from \"thinks there are 10g/kg\" or other listed misconceptions.",
