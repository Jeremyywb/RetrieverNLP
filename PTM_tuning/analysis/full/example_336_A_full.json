  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 2.75 \u00d7 8 = 22  \nStudent's likely calculation: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24  \nThe student treated the partial symbol (0.75 of a face) as a whole symbol by rounding 2.75 faces up to 3. This caused them to multiply 3 symbols by 8 people/symbol instead of using the exact fractional value. The error stems from disregarding the mathematical meaning of partial symbols in pictograms, converting them to whole numbers through estimation rather than direct proportional calculation. This specifically matches the partial symbol misconception rather than key value misapplication (they used 8 correctly) or additive errors. The student's rounding decision substituted precise multiplication with an invalid approximation.",
