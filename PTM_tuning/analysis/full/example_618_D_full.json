  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{13}{40} = 0.325 \\), then \\( 0.325 \\times 100 = 32.5\\% \\).\n\nStudent's error: \\( 13 \\times 40 = 520 \\), then wrote 52% (likely dividing 520 by 10). \n\nThe flaw stems from treating fraction conversion as multiplication of numerator and denominator instead of division. This produced an inflated value (520), which the student erroneously scaled down by a factor of 10 to create a percentage-like number. \n\nThis matches multiplying numerator/denominator (primary misconception), not other errors like subtraction (which would yield 27 \u2192 2700%) or doubling (26%). The 10x reduction shows awareness that percentages are fractions of 100, ruling out \"doesn't understand percentages\" as the core issue.",
