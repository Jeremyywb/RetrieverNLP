  "explanation": "The correct calculation is \\(4\\, \\mathrm{L} \\times 1000\\, \\mathrm{cm}^3/\\mathrm{L} = 4000\\, \\mathrm{cm}^3\\). The student retained the original value \\(4\\) without applying any conversion factor. \n\nThe error stems from treating litres and cubic centimetres as directly equivalent units. The student failed to recognize that litres measure volume and require conversion to cubic centimetres using \\(1\\, \\mathrm{L} = 1000\\, \\mathrm{cm}^3\\). This reflects a lack of understanding that distinct volume units necessitate a multiplicative conversion step. \n\nThe misconception aligns with not recognizing litres as a volume unit requiring conversion, rather than errors in cubing linear units or dividing instead of multiplying. The identical numerical answer (\\(4\\)) shows no attempt to apply volume-specific conversion rules, distinguishing this from arithmetic errors or unit-cubing oversights.",
