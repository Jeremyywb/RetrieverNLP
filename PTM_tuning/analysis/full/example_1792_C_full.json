  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 2 \\times (8\\,\\text{cm} + 5\\,\\text{cm}) = 26\\,\\text{cm} \\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\( 8\\,\\text{cm} \\times 5\\,\\text{cm} = 40\\,\\text{cm} \\).  \n\nThe student multiplied the base and height directly, using the formula for area instead of perimeter. This shows they conflated the two concepts: perimeter requires summing all sides (via addition and doubling), while area uses multiplication. The error directly stems from misapplying the area formula to a perimeter problem.  \n\nThis is distinct from merely \"multiplying instead of adding,\" as the error specifically substitutes the *purpose* of multiplication (calculating space) for the additive nature of perimeter. Other misconceptions like ignoring side properties (e.g., opposite sides being equal) would not produce 40, as even partial addition would yield a smaller value.",
