  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\) (base multiplied by perpendicular height)\nStudent's calculation: \\( \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\)\n\nThe student divided the product of base and height by 2, erroneously applying the triangle area formula to a parallelogram. This occurred precisely at the step where they converted the product into a final answer, introducing an unwarranted division. The error stems from conflating the parallelogram area formula with the triangle formula, despite the problem's explicit mention of a \"parallelogram.\" This distinguishes it from other listed misconceptions like using slant height (which would involve 6cm) or omitting a dimension entirely. The halved result directly matches the signature of triangle area confusion rather than other additive or multiplicative errors.",
