  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires moving two positions backward from the 3rd term in a descending sequence: \\(712 + 22 = 734\\) (2nd term), then \\(734 + 22 = 756\\) (1st term). \n\nThe student likely computed only one backward step: \\(712 + 22 = 734\\), stopping at the 2nd term. \n\nThe error stems from misaligning term positions - the student treated the star's position as directly adjacent to the 3rd term (requiring one increment) rather than two positions prior (requiring two increments). \n\nThis matches the misconception of confusing term positions, as they failed to account for the distance between the 3rd term and the star's position. \n\nIt differs from subtraction errors (they correctly added) or term-to-term rule mistakes (they applied the constant difference properly, but insufficiently).",
