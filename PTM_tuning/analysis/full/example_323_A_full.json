  "explanation": "To factorize \\( x^2 + 15x + 36 \\), we seek two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( a + b = 15 \\) and \\( a \\cdot b = 36 \\). The correct pair is \\( 3 \\) and \\( 12 \\), yielding \\( (x+3)(x+12) \\).\n\nThe student chose \\( 4 \\) and \\( 9 \\), which multiply to \\( 36 \\), but their sum is \\( 13 \\), not \\( 15 \\). This indicates they identified a valid factor pair of \\( 36 \\) but failed to verify whether those numbers also satisfy the required sum for the linear term. \n\nThe error stems from misaligning the additive and multiplicative requirements: while they correctly prioritized the product \\( 36 \\), they neglected to confirm that \\( 4 + 9 = 15 \\). This distinguishes the error from misconceptions like confusing sum/product roles or arithmetic mistakes, as the flaw lies specifically in selecting a valid product pair that does not meet the sum criterion.",
