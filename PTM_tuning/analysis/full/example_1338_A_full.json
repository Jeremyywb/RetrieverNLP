  "explanation": "The correct method subtracts each fraction from 1:  \n\\(1 - \\frac{9}{10} = \\frac{1}{10}\\) (distance \u2248 0.1)  \n\\(|1 - \\frac{4}{3}| = \\frac{1}{3}\\) (distance \u2248 0.33).  \n\nThe student likely calculated \\(10 - 9 = 1\\) and \\(4 - 3 = 1\\), concluding both fractions are equally close to 1.  \nThis error stems from treating the difference between numerator and denominator as equivalent to the actual distance from 1.  \nThe misconception conflates arithmetic difference with proportional value, ignoring that \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is three times larger than \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\).  \nIt differs from confusing mixed/improper fractions, as the student correctly converted \\(1\\frac{1}{3}\\) to \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) but misapplied the comparison metric.  \nThe error specifically arises from prioritizing digit relationships over magnitude analysis.",
