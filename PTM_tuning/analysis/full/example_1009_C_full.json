  "explanation": "The correct next step would be to multiply both sides by 2:\n\\[\n2\\left(\\frac{3x}{2} + 1\\right) = 2(1.6) \\implies 3x + 2 = 3.2\n\\]\nKatie incorrectly derived \\(3x + 2 = 2.12\\). The error occurs in the right-hand side calculation: \\(1.6 \\times 2 = 3.2\\), not 2.12. This indicates the student likely multiplied the left-side terms correctly but failed to apply the same multiplier (2) to the entire right side, treating 1.6 as a separate entity requiring different handling. \n\nThe flaw stems from not recognizing that multiplying *both sides* requires uniform application to all terms. While the left side shows proper term-by-term multiplication, the right side's incorrect result (2.12) reveals selective multiplication rather than a general arithmetic error. This differs from related misconceptions like ignoring constants during fraction elimination, as Katie *did* multiply the constant term (+1) correctly but mishandled the right side's totality.",
