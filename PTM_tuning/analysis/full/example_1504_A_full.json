  "explanation": "The correct calculation for powers of 4 shows \\(4^1 = 4\\), \\(4^2 = 16\\), \\(4^3 = 64\\). \n\nThe student likely reasoned: \"A power of 4 involves repeating the digit 4,\" leading them to conclude \\(44\\) by writing two 4s. \n\nThis error stems from conflating exponentiation with numeral repetition. Instead of computing \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) (for \\(4^2\\)) or \\(4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64\\) (for \\(4^3\\)), they treated the exponent as a count of digit repetitions. \n\nThe misconception directly caused the error: they replaced multiplicative growth with digit duplication, producing \\(44\\). This differs from \"multiplies by the index\" (e.g., \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) for \\(4^3\\)) or misunderstanding roots, as the error is purely about numeral representation, not arithmetic operations. \n\nThe key distinction is the substitution of digit repetition for exponentiation, rather than incorrect multiplication or root confusion.",
