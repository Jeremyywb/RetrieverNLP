  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3000 \\, \\text{ml} \\div 1000 = 3 \\, \\text{liters} \\).  \nStudent's error: \\( 3000 \\, \\text{ml} \\div 100 = 30 \\, \\text{liters} \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly divided by 100 instead of 1000, treating milliliters as if they convert to liters by a factor of 100. This stems from misapplying the metric prefix \"milli-\" (which denotes \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\)) as if it were \"centi-\" (\\( \\frac{1}{100} \\)). Their reasoning conflated the conversion steps for different metric prefixes, leading to an answer 10 times too large.  \n\nThis error is distinct from thinking there are 10,000 ml in a liter (which would result in 0.3 liters) or multiplying instead of dividing (which would yield 3,000,000 liters). The specific misuse of the 100:1 ratio directly aligns with confusion between metric prefixes rather than arithmetic inversion or unit magnitude errors.",
