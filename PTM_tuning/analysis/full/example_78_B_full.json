  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 24 \\div 6 = 4 \\). The height is found by dividing area by base.\n\nStudent's error: \\( 24 \\div 6 = 4 \\), then \\( 4 \\div 2 = 2 \\).\n\nThe student applied the parallelogram area formula \\( \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\) but incorrectly divided the result by 2. This extra division mirrors the formula for triangles (\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\)), not parallelograms. \n\nThe error stems from conflating the two formulas, inserting an unnecessary halving step. This matches the first listed misconception (dividing by 2 as in triangle area), not the others. For example, if the student had used the shorter side or failed to rearrange the formula, the error would differ structurally (e.g., \\( 24 \\div \\text{shorter side} \\) instead of \\( 24 \\div 6 \\div 2 \\)).",
