  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes that both \u03c0 and 1/\u03c0 are irrational because \u03c0 cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers, and reciprocals of irrationals remain irrational. \n\nThe student likely assumed \\( \\frac{1}{\\pi} = \\pi \\), treating reciprocal as equivalent to the original number. This would imply \\( \\pi^2 = 1 \\), falsely concluding \\( \\pi = 1 \\), a rational number. \n\nThe misconception that reciprocals equal their original numbers caused the student to incorrectly equate \u03c0 to a rational value (1) and extend this to \\( \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\). This directly explains the \"both\" answer, as the flawed equality artificially created two rational numbers. \n\nThis differs from confusion about division commutativity (which would preserve irrationality) or misclassifying fractions (since neither number is a ratio of integers). The error stems specifically from the invalid reciprocal equivalence, not from general fraction misinterpretations.",
