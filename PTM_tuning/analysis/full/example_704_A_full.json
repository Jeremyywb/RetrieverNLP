  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Square area = 16 cm\u00b2 \u2192 side length = 4 cm\n2. Combined shape perimeter = 30 cm\n3. When joined, perimeter equation becomes 2*(4 + (4 + x)) = 30 \u2192 x = 7 cm\n4. Rectangle area = 4*7 = 28 cm\u00b2\n5. Total area = 16 + 28 = 44 cm\u00b2\n\nStudent's error:\n- Calculated square side correctly (4 cm)\n- Assumed rectangle area = square's side length (4 cm\u00b2)\n- Added nothing (or treated 4 cm as total area)\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student identified the square's side length but failed to connect perimeter information to calculate the rectangle's dimensions. They incorrectly equated a linear measurement (4 cm) with area units (cm\u00b2), bypassing all required steps to derive the rectangle's length from the perimeter. This stems from an inability to use perimeter constraints to find missing dimensions in composite shapes.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nWhile \"confuses perimeter and area\" might seem applicable, the core issue was treating a known length as an area value without any perimeter-to-area conversion attempt. The error specifically shows absence of dimensional analysis, not direct confusion between perimeter/area calculations.",
