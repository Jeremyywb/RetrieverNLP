  "explanation": "The correct method requires finding numbers that add to 5 (coefficient of x) and multiply to 6 (constant term). The student incorrectly stated \"add to give 5x\" instead of 5. This error occurs when misinterpreting the \"5x\" term as requiring the sum to include the variable x, rather than treating the coefficient (5) separately from the variable. The misconception stems from conflating the term's algebraic representation (5x) with the numerical value required for factoring (5). This specifically differs from related misconceptions about multiplication errors, as the student correctly handled the product (6) but misapplied addition to the variable-containing term. The error shows confusion about isolating coefficients when factoring, not misunderstanding multiplication of variables.",
