  "explanation": "The correct factorization follows:\n\\( 9x^2 -24x +16 = (3x)^2 - 2(3x)(4) + 4^2 = (3x -4)^2 \\).\n\nThe student's answer expands to:\n\\( (3x +4)^2 = 9x^2 +24x +16 \\), which incorrectly produces a positive middle term (+24x).\n\nThe student recognized the structure of a perfect square but misapplied the sign. The middle term (-24x) requires the binomial to have matching subtraction signs to produce \\(-2(3x)(4)\\). The student likely assumed the positive constant term (+16) necessitates both factors to be positive, ignoring the middle term's sign. This directly aligns with misunderstanding how sign pairs in binomials relate to the trinomial's middle term, not with errors about negative number multiplication rules. The error is distinct from misconceptions about squaring negatives, as the flaw lies in sign coordination during factorization, not computational sign handling.",
