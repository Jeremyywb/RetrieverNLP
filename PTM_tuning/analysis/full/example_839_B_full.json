  "explanation": "Correct comparison:\n1. 76426 vs. 76462: Compare digit-by-digit left to right. First differing digit at 10^3 place (2 vs. 6). Since 2 < 6, 76426 < 76462.\n2. 76462 vs. 74662: First differing digit at 10^4 place (6 vs. 4). Since 6 > 4, 76462 > 74662.\n\nStudent's incorrect reasoning:\n- Correctly compared 76426 < 76462 using left-to-right comparison.\n- When comparing 76462 vs. 74662, either:\n  a) Mistakenly focused on the third digit (4 vs. 6) instead of the second digit (6 vs. 4), or\n  b) Failed to recognize that the second digit's difference (6 vs. 4) determines the entire comparison.\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student continued comparing digits beyond the first differing place value (10^4 place) and prioritized a later digit (10^3 place) over the earlier, decisive digit. This violates the rule that comparisons are resolved at the first leftmost differing digit.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThe error directly stems from not terminating the comparison at the first differing digit (6 vs. 4 in the 10^4 place) and instead using a subsequent digit (4 vs. 6 in the 10^3 place) to reverse the correct order.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis differs from symbol confusion (they used < correctly in the first comparison) or end-digit comparisons (they used left-to-right). The core failure was prioritizing a less significant digit over a decisive earlier one.",
