  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes that in rectangle \\(ABCD\\), sides \\(BC\\) and \\(CD\\) are adjacent sides with lengths \\(l\\) and \\(w\\) (length and width), and diagonal \\(BD\\) splits the rectangle. By the rectangle's properties, angle \\(C\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\), making \\(\\triangle BCD\\) right-angled. \n\nThe student likely observed \\(BC\\) and \\(CD\\) as sides of the rectangle but incorrectly assumed they are equal (i.e., \\(l = w\\)), concluding \\(\\triangle BCD\\) has two equal sides. This stems from assuming adjacent sides in a rectangle are equal, a property unique to squares. \n\nThe error directly aligns with the misconception of assuming line segments are equal without verifying their relationships. The student treated the rectangle as a square (where \\(BC = CD\\)), despite no indication of equal sides. This differs from misconceptions about side markings or right-angle orientation, as the focus is specifically on erroneously equating adjacent sides.",
