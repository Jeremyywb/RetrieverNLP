  "explanation": "To eliminate \\( l \\), the correct method multiplies the first equation by 3:  \n\\( 3(2l + 3m) = 3(13) \\Rightarrow 6l + 9m = 39 \\),  \nand the second by 2:  \n\\( 2(3l + 4m) = 2(17) \\Rightarrow 6l + 8m = 34 \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly transformed the equations to:  \n\\( 6l + 3m = 13 \\) and \\( 6l + 4m = 17 \\).  \n\nThis shows they multiplied only the \\( l \\)-terms (2l\u21926l, 3l\u21926l) but neglected to apply the same multiplier to the \\( m \\)-terms and constants.  \n\nThe error stems from treating the coefficients of \\( l \\) in isolation rather than scaling all terms in each equation equally. This violates the equality-preserving requirement of equation transformations.  \n\nThe related misconception about LCM usage doesn\u2019t apply here, as the student didn\u2019t attempt to use a common multiple for elimination. The flaw is strictly in partial term multiplication, not LCM logic.",
