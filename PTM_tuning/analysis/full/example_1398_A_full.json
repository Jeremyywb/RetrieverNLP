  "explanation": "The correct reciprocal graph shows two hyperbola branches in quadrants I and III, approaching both axes asymptotically without intersecting them. The student's drawn graph crosses the y-axis (passing through a point above the origin) and lacks asymptotic behavior toward the x-axis. \n\nThe student incorrectly associated the steep vertical rise of a cubic function (e.g., y=x\u00b3) with reciprocal behavior. They focused on the steepness of curvature near the origin but failed to recognize that reciprocal functions cannot intersect either axis due to vertical/horizontal asymptotes. This directly reflects a confusion between the asymptotic nature of reciprocal functions and the unconstrained growth of cubic functions. \n\nWhile quadratic confusion is listed as a related misconception, the student's graph shows no parabolic shape or vertex - the error specifically stems from misattributing cubic-like growth to reciprocal relationships rather than quadratic ones.",
