  "explanation": "The correct calculation is \\( 3 \\div 4 \\), as the fraction \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) directly represents division of 3 by 4.  \nThe student wrote \\( 3 - 4 \\), substituting subtraction for division.  \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the fraction's horizontal bar (which denotes division) as requiring subtraction instead. The student likely associated the separation of numerator and denominator with \"taking away\" rather than partitioning.  \nThis aligns with the primary misconception of not recognizing fractions as division operations. The student selected an arithmetic operation (subtraction) that superficially connects to the fraction's structure (two numbers separated by a line) but ignores its mathematical meaning.  \n\nThis is distinct from misconceptions about notation or word problems, as the error directly reflects confusion about the fraction symbol itself. The student's reasoning diverged at the critical step of translating the fraction's format to an operation.",
