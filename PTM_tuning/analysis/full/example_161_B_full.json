  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The sequence starts at 6 with a constant difference of 4. For the 7th term:  \n\\(6 + 4 \\times (7 - 1) = 6 + 24 = 30\\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:  \nThey likely computed \\(4 \\times 7 - 2 = 26\\), subtracting 2 instead of adding 6. \n\nReasoning flaw: The student recognized the constant difference (4) but incorrectly assumed the formula was \\(4n - 2\\) instead of \\(4n + 2\\). They derived the \"-2\" offset from the difference between \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\) and the actual first term (6), but misapplied it as subtraction rather than addition. \n\nConnection to misconception: This error stems from improperly reconciling the constant difference with the initial term, treating the first term as a correction to the product \\(4n\\) rather than part of a linear formula. \n\nDistinction: Unlike simply forgetting the first term, the student attempted to incorporate it but inverted the sign, showing a deeper misunderstanding of how the initial term interacts with the common difference in the sequence formula.",
