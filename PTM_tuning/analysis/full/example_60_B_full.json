  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Simplify 7/21 by dividing numerator and denominator by 7 \u2192 1/3. Combine with the whole number: 3 + 1/3 = 3\u202f1/3.\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: Treated the numerator 7 in 7/21 as the whole number part. Simplified 7/21 to 1/3, then used 7 \u00f7 7 = 1 as the new whole number (1\u202f1/3).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student incorrectly replaced the original whole number (3) with the quotient of the numerator (7 \u00f7 7 = 1) when simplifying the fractional part, rather than retaining the original whole number.\n\nConnection to misconception: This shows a direct substitution of the numerator's simplified result into the whole number position, conflating the separate roles of whole numbers and numerators in mixed numbers.\n\nDistinguishing from related errors: The error isn't about improper fraction conversion (the student didn't calculate (3\u00d721)+7) or notation misunderstanding, but specifically misassigning the numerator's value to the whole number.\n\nFinal confirmation: The mismatch between the original whole number (3) and the student's result (1) stems exclusively from treating the numerator as the source of the new whole number.",
