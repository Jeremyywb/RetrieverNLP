  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes that a triangle with angles \\(90^\\circ, 45^\\circ, 45^\\circ\\) satisfies both statements:  \n1. It is right-angled (contains a \\(90^\\circ\\) angle).  \n2. It is isosceles (two equal angles imply two equal sides).  \n\nThe student incorrectly rejected Statement 1 while accepting Statement 2. Their reasoning likely fixated on the isosceles property (two equal angles) but failed to connect the \\(90^\\circ\\) angle to the definition of a right-angled triangle. The flaw stems from assuming a right-angled triangle cannot simultaneously have equal sides or angles, despite the explicit \\(90^\\circ\\) angle fulfilling Statement 1. This aligns with overgeneralizing properties of right triangles (e.g., assuming they must have unequal legs) rather than applying definitions directly. The error is distinct from not knowing isosceles properties, as the student correctly identified Statement 2.",
