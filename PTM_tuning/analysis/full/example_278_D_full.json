  "explanation": "The correct number line uses a hollow circle at -3 (excluded) and filled circle at 1 (included) to represent \\( -3 < x \\leq 1 \\). The student reversed these markers, placing a filled circle at -3 and hollow circle at 1. \n\nThis error stems from misapplying the inclusion/exclusion rules for inequality symbols: they treated the strict inequality (\\(<\\)) at -3 as inclusive (filled) and the non-strict inequality (\\(\\leq\\)) at 1 as exclusive (hollow). This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how inequality notation dictates endpoint representation on number lines.\n\nThe misconception differs from mixing greater/less symbols (which would reverse interval direction) or misplacing endpoints (which would shift positions). The student maintained the correct interval range but inverted the symbol-to-circle correspondence, specifically confusing exclusion/inclusion rules for each inequality type.",
