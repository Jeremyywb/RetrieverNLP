  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(130\\% \\times 40 = 1.3 \\times 40 = 52\\)\n\nStudent's error: Likely added \\(130 + 40 = 170\\)\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the percentage as a fixed value to add rather than a ratio to apply. This shows they confused percentage notation with absolute addition values, failing to convert the percentage to a decimal multiplier. \n\nConnection to misconception: The error stems from misinterpreting what \"of\" means in percentage operations - instead of multiplying \\(130\\%\\) by 40, they combined the raw numbers additively.\n\nDistinction: This differs from simply using \"130\" as the answer (which would be the first listed misconception) or miscalculating the conversion. The error specifically demonstrates a failure to recognize percentage operations require proportional scaling of the base amount.\n\nKey evidence: The answer matches exactly \\(130 + 40\\), showing additive reasoning rather than multiplicative application of the percentage.",
