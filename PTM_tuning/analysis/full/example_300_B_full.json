  "explanation": "The correct approach converts all values to decimals: 0.2, 0.18, 0.45, 0.21, 0.2, 0.19. These cluster around 0.18-0.21 except 0.45. The student likely compared denominators directly, interpreting 19/100 as \"smaller\" due to its large denominator (100 vs. 20 in 9/20). This caused them to incorrectly identify the smallest denominator fraction (9/20) as normal and 19/100 as deviant. The error stems from prioritizing denominator size over magnitude comparison through conversion. This contrasts with the related misconception about decimal conversion errors, as the student correctly converted 19/100 to 0.19 but failed to recognize the true outlier's magnitude.",
