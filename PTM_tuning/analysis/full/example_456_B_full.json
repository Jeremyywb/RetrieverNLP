  "explanation": "To determine if a sequence is arithmetic, check if the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Tom's sequence: \\(8 - 5 = 3\\), \\(11 - 8 = 3\\), confirming a constant difference. Katie's sequence: \\(15 - 5 = 10\\), \\(45 - 15 = 30\\), showing the differences are not constant. \n\nThe student incorrectly concluded Katie's sequence is arithmetic. This error stems from misinterpreting the multiplicative relationship (each term multiplied by 3) as sufficient for an arithmetic sequence. Arithmetic sequences require additive consistency, not multiplicative. \n\nThe student conflated the definitions of arithmetic and geometric sequences, treating the multiplicative pattern as valid for arithmetic. This distinguishes it from related errors like checking only one term difference, as the multiplicative pattern persists across all terms but still violates the additive requirement.",
