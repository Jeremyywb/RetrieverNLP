  "explanation": "To construct a triangle with two given sides and an included angle (SAS), the correct method uses a ruler to draw the first side, a protractor to measure the specified angle, then a ruler again to mark the second side's length. The student's answer (ruler + compass) incorrectly assumes arcs must be drawn for angle creation. The error stems from conflating angle construction via protractor (direct measurement) with compass-based arc intersections used in side-side-side constructions. This reflects a misunderstanding of how SAS triangles are built: when the angle is already provided, no compass arcs are needed to transfer angles. The misconception specifically relates to misapplying compass requirements to angle-creation steps, distinct from forgetting compass use in arc-drawing generally.",
