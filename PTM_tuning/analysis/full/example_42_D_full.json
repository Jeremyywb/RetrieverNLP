  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes parallel lines must maintain identical gradients (5) regardless of position. The student's answer (\"Not enough information\") suggests they assumed additional parameters (e.g., y-intercept) are required to confirm parallelism. Their reasoning diverged by failing to isolate gradient as the sole determinant of parallel lines. This directly stems from not recognizing that parallelism depends exclusively on matching angles (via equal gradients), not position or intercepts. The error is distinct from believing intercepts can substitute for gradients, as the student didn't claim both are needed, but rather omitted the understanding that gradients alone suffice.",
