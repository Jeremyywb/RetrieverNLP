  "explanation": "The correct denominator calculates the total number of ways to pick 3 distinct balls without replacement: \\(9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 504\\). \n\nThe student likely computed \\(9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 729\\), treating each selection as independent (with replacement). \n\nThis error stems from misapplying replacement to a scenario where balls are removed simultaneously. The student assumed the total pool remains constant across selections, ignoring the reduction in available balls. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of not recognizing that combined selections reduce the total pool. It differs from adding probabilities (they multiplied) or including extra possibilities (they correctly counted ordered triples but with replacement).",
