  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes that alternate angles are formed by a transversal intersecting two lines. For alternate angles to be equal, those two lines must be parallel. Here, the lines are non-parallel, so while \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are indeed alternate angles (Tom's claim), they cannot be assumed equal (contradicting Katie's claim).\n\nThe student likely observed the angles' positions (on opposite sides of the transversal) and concluded they were both alternate **and** equal. This conflates the definition of alternate angles (a positional relationship) with the property that they are equal **only when lines are parallel**. \n\nThe error stems from failing to recognize that parallel lines are a necessary condition for alternate angles to be equal. The student treated positional alternation as sufficient for equality, ignoring the diagram's non-parallel lines. This aligns with the primary misconception, as it specifically involves overlooking the role of parallelism in angle equality. \n\nThis differs from confusing alternate with opposite angles (which would involve vertical angles) or corresponding angles (which share the same relative position at each intersection). The student correctly identified the angles as alternate but misapplied the equality condition.",
