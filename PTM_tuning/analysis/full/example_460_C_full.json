  "explanation": "The correct equation with no real solutions is \\( t^2 = -27 \\) because squaring any real number cannot produce a negative value. The student incorrectly identified \\( t^3 = -27 \\) as having no solutions, likely reasoning that negative numbers under roots are invalid. However, cube roots of negative numbers *are* real (e.g., \\( t = -3 \\) satisfies \\( t^3 = -27 \\)). The student misapplied the rule for *even* roots (like square roots) to an *odd* root (cubic), assuming all roots of negatives are undefined. This differs from related misconceptions about square roots of non-perfect squares or negative roots, as it specifically conflates even/odd exponent properties. The error stems from failing to recognize that odd-degree equations preserve sign and always have real solutions.",
