  "explanation": "To solve \\( x^2 < 2 \\), the correct method identifies where the parabola \\( y = x^2 \\) lies below \\( y = 2 \\). This occurs between the roots \\( x = \\pm\\sqrt{2} \\approx \\pm1.4 \\), yielding \\( -1.4 < x < 1.4 \\). \n\nThe student incorrectly selected \\( x < -1.4 \\) or \\( x > 1.4 \\), which corresponds to where \\( y = x^2 \\) is above \\( y = 2 \\). Their reasoning flaw stems from misinterpreting the inequality's graphical representation: they associated the solution with the regions where the quadratic exceeds the constant value, rather than where it lies beneath. \n\nThis aligns with confusing the shaded (solution) and unshaded regions on the graph. The error is distinct from mixing inequality symbols (e.g., writing \\( x^2 > 2 \\) instead) or misunderstanding \"less than\" notation, as the student's intervals correctly reflect the roots but invert the inequality's directional interpretation.",
