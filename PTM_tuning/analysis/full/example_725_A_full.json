  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The output 7 results from subtracting 3 from the input. To reverse this, add 3 to the output: \\( 7 + 3 = 10 \\).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely computed \\( 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\), treating multiplication as the inverse operation for subtraction.\n\nReasoning flaw: The student incorrectly assumed multiplication (rather than addition) reverses subtraction. This stems from misapplying inverse operations, where they conflated multiplicative inverses with additive ones.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly reflects a belief that inverse operations involve switching operation types (e.g., multiplication for subtraction), rather than recognizing subtraction and addition as inverses.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike errors involving order reversal without inverse operations, the student applied an incorrect inverse (multiplication) rather than failing to reverse steps. This specifically aligns with misidentifying inverses, not procedural ordering.",
