  "explanation": "Correct calculation for 1 SF:  \n605.76 \u2192 600 (6 is first SF, next digit 0 <5, round down)  \nCorrect calculation for 2 SF:  \n605.76 \u2192 610 (second SF is 0, next digit 5 \u22655, round up 0\u21921)  \n\nStudent's incorrect calculation for 2 SF:  \n605.76 \u2192 600 (likely treated both digits 6 and 0 as fixed, ignoring the 5)  \n\nThe error occurred when rounding to 2 significant figures. The student failed to recognize that the third digit (5) requires rounding the second SF (0) up to 1. This converts 60_ to 61_, resulting in 610.  \n\nThe misconception manifests as treating the first two digits as immutable \"significant figure blocks\" rather than understanding that rounding propagates through place values when digits \u22655 follow. This differs from truncation (which would yield 600) because the student likely recognized the need to round but misapplied the carry-over rule.  \n\nThe error directly matches applying incorrect rounding rules for multi-digit adjustments, distinct from placeholder confusion (which would involve zero-counting errors) or truncation (which would discard digits without considering rounding thresholds).",
