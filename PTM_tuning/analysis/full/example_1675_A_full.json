  "explanation": "The correct method uses a ruler to draw two sides with given lengths and a protractor to measure the specified angle. The student likely assumed the angle required a protractor (correct) but incorrectly included a compass. This suggests they believed the compass was necessary to replicate side lengths, despite the sides being directly measurable with a ruler. The error stems from misunderstanding the compass's purpose\u2014it is used for transferring lengths via arcs, not when lengths are explicitly given. This aligns with the stated misconception about compass function, as the student conflated its role with the ruler's. Distinguishing from related errors: the answer doesn't involve angle placement (first listed misconception) or misinterpretation of dashes/symbols (third/second misconceptions), focusing solely on tool misapplication.",
