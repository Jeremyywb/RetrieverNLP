  "explanation": "The correct sequence follows the pattern where each term equals the sum of natural numbers up to n (1, 1+2, 1+2+3, etc.), resulting in differences that increase by 1: 2, 3, 4, 5... The student likely observed that terms increase through addition but incorrectly assumed the Fibonacci rule (summing two prior terms). For example, they might have tested 1+3=4 (not the next term, 6) but still misattributed the pattern. This shows they conflated additive sequences generally with Fibonacci's specific two-term rule. The error aligns with not knowing the precise term-to-term rule for triangle numbers, as opposed to related misconceptions like incorrect difference patterns or using insufficient terms to determine a rule. The student's reasoning diverged by applying an additive principle without verifying its mathematical structure.",
