  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(27^{\\frac{4}{3}} = (\\sqrt[3]{27})^4 = 3^4 = 81\\).\n\nStudent's likely steps: \\(27 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 36\\).\n\nThe error occurred by treating the fractional exponent \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) as a multiplicative factor instead of an operation sequence. The student multiplied the base by the numerator (4) and divided by the denominator (3), bypassing the required root-then-power structure of fractional exponents. This directly aligns with confusing the exponent's numerator for a direct multiplier rather than recognizing it as the subsequent power after applying the root (denominator). \n\nThis differs from swapping root/power order (which would yield \\(27^{\\frac{3}{4}} \\neq 36\\)) or multiplying before applying exponents (which would involve intermediate steps with powers). The error stems purely from misinterpreting the fractional exponent as linear scaling.",
