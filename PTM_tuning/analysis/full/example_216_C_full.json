  "explanation": "To determine parallel lines, we compare slopes (coefficients of x). Correct analysis:\n- Tom's lines: y=2x+3 (slope 2) and y=3x+2 (slope 3) \u2192 different slopes \u2192 not parallel\n- Katie's lines: y=2x+3 and y=2x-3 (both slope 2) \u2192 same slope \u2192 parallel\n\nThe student incorrectly concluded both pairs are parallel. Their error occurred when analyzing Tom's lines. They likely:\n1. Recognized parallel lines require matching slopes or y-intercepts (misconception)\n2. Observed Tom's equations contain the numbers 2 and 3 in both equations\n3. Incorrectly assumed these numbers created matching components (either slope or intercept)\n\nHowever, Tom's lines have neither matching slopes (2 vs 3) nor matching y-intercepts (3 vs 2). The student failed to distinguish between slope and constant term positions in y=mx+c, treating numerical overlap as sufficient for parallelism. This differs from confusing c/m roles, as they still identified Katie's correct pair properly via slope matching.",
