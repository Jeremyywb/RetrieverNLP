  "explanation": "The correct calculation determines \\( Q=1.5 \\) by observing the first horizontal segment ends at \\( x=1.5 \\). The student incorrectly chose \\( Q=1 \\), likely assuming the interval \\( 0 \\leq x < Q \\) must span exactly 1 unit (from 0 to 1). This reflects a misconception that piecewise intervals always increase in whole-number increments, despite the graph explicitly showing the first segment terminating at \\( x=1.5 \\). The error stems from imposing an assumed unit-step pattern rather than reading the actual endpoint from the graph coordinates. This is distinct from scaling misinterpretations, as the mistake involves interval length assumptions, not misreading axis labels or grid lines. The student correctly identified \\( P=2 \\), confirming they interpreted the y-values properly, further isolating the error to interval endpoint reasoning.",
