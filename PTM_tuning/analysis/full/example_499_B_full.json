  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 50 trees \u00f7 20 trees/symbol = 2.5 symbols.  \nStudent's error: 50 \u00f7 10 = 5 (assuming 10 trees/symbol).  \n\nThe student likely misinterpreted the pictogram key by treating a half-symbol value (10 trees) as the base unit instead of the full symbol (20 trees). This caused them to divide 50 by 10 (the value of a half-symbol) rather than 20. The error stems from misapplying the scale: they derived a unit from partial symbols instead of using the explicitly defined key.  \n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception of misinterpreting scaling factors, as they substituted the given 20-tree unit with an inferred 10-tree unit. It differs from \"ignores partial symbols\" because the error specifically involves misusing partial-symbol values to redefine the scale.",
