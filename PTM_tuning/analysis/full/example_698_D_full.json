  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The probability of 1 on the first spinner is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) on the second. Multiplying these gives \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely computed \\( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{20} \\), adding numerators (1+1=2) and multiplying denominators (4\u00d75=20).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student incorrectly combined fractions by adding numerators while multiplying denominators, violating the fundamental rule for multiplying probabilities. This reflects a confusion about fraction operations in probability contexts.\n\nDistinction: This differs from simply adding probabilities (which would yield \\( \\frac{9}{20} \\)) or multiplying numerators/denominators separately (which would produce \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\) correctly). The error specifically stems from hybridizing addition and multiplication steps.",
