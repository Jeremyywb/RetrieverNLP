  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( a^{2} \\times a = a^{2+1} = a^{3} \\)\n\nIncorrect reasoning: The student likely treated \\( a^{2} \\) and \\( a \\) as unlike terms that cannot be combined, similar to how \\( x^{2} + x \\) cannot be simplified. They failed to recognize the multiplication operator requires applying the law of exponents for like bases.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student did not identify the implicit exponent in \\( a \\) (equivalent to \\( a^{1} \\)) or apply the rule \\( a^{m} \\times a^{n} = a^{m+n} \\). This indicates a failure to connect the multiplication operation with exponent addition.\n\nDistinction from related errors: While power notation understanding is involved, the core issue is misapplying the exponent addition rule (laws of indices), not confusion about coefficient defaults or term collection in addition contexts. The error stems from treating the multiplication as uncombinable terms rather than exponents requiring addition.\n\nThis directly aligns with the laws of indices misconception, as the student overlooked the fundamental rule governing multiplication of exponential terms with shared bases.",
