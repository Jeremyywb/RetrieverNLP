  "explanation": "The correct interpretation follows order of operations: first multiply \\( m \\times n \\), then add 5, yielding \\( mn + 5 \\). The student instead wrote \\( m(n+5) \\), which prioritizes adding 5 to \\( n \\) before multiplication. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying operation sequence: the phrase \"then add 5\" explicitly indicates the addition occurs after the multiplication is completed. By placing parentheses around \\( n+5 \\), the student incorrectly fused the two operations into a single step, reversing their intended order. This directly reflects a failure to parse the temporal sequence implied by \"then\" in the wording, treating the addition as part of the multiplicative term instead of a subsequent action. \n\nThis explanation better fits the primary misconception than alternatives like unnecessary parentheses use, as the parentheses here actively alter the operation order rather than merely being redundant.",
