  "explanation": "The correct conversion:  \n\\(1.4 = 1 + 0.4 = \\frac{10}{10} + \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{14}{10} = \\frac{7}{5}\\).  \n\nThe student's reasoning:  \nRejected conversion because \\(1.4 > 1\\), concluding fractions cannot represent values exceeding 1.  \n\nFlaw:  \nThe student assumed fractions must always represent values \u22641 (proper fractions). This directly caused them to abandon the conversion process entirely, despite knowing the decimal value.  \n\nConnection to misconception:  \nThe error stems from believing fractions are restricted to proper forms, ignoring improper fractions. This is distinct from calculation errors in decimal-to-fraction conversion steps or simplification issues.  \n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThe student didn't fail to perform arithmetic (like converting 0.4 to \\(\\frac{4}{10}\\)) or misunderstand equivalence - they rejected the entire concept of improper fractions.",
