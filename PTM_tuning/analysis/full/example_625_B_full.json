  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n\\( 4\\% = \\frac{4}{100} = \\frac{1}{25} \\) (simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 4).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:  \n\\( 4\\% = \\frac{4}{10} \\).\n\nThe student treated the percentage value as equivalent to tenths instead of hundredths. They incorrectly divided 4 by 10 (interpreting \"%\" as tenths) rather than 100. This reflects a belief that percentages inherently correspond to fractions with denominator 10, likely conflating the \"%\" symbol with tenths (as in decimal fractions like 0.4 = 4/10). \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the relationship between percentages and denominators. For example, they may have overgeneralized from examples like \\(10\\% = \\frac{1}{10}\\) to assume all percentages use 10 as the denominator. This directly matches the misconception of dividing by 10 instead of 100, distinguishing it from other errors like misunderstanding simplification (e.g., dividing 4/100 by 4 incorrectly) or misapplying diagrams partitioned into 10% increments.",
