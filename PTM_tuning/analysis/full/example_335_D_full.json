  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nJo's method: Adding 19 = +10 +10 -1 (equivalent to +19)\nPaul's method: Subtracting 19 = -10 -10 +1 (equivalent to -19)\n\nStudent's flawed reasoning:\nIf calculating 30 +19 via Jo's method:\n30 +10 =40 \u2192 40 +10 =50 \u2192 50 -1 =49 (correct)\nBut student might have thought:\n\"Adding 10 twice makes +20, then -1 = +19 total. But you should add 19 directly - these are different processes!\"\n\nFor subtraction (50 -19 via Paul's method):\n50 -10 =40 \u2192 40 -10 =30 \u2192 30 +1 =31 (correct)\nStudent likely reasoned:\n\"Subtracting 10 twice removes 20, then +1 only gives back 1. This removes 19 total? No - 20-1=19 removed? That can't be right.\"\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student failed to recognize that sequential operations (+10 +10 -1) are mathematically identical to single operations (+19). They treated the compensation step (-1 or +1) as separate from the cumulative total rather than part of a net equivalent value.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis isn't about order of operations (commutativity) or misreading problems. The core issue is not seeing that multi-step compensation achieves the same net effect as single-step calculation.",
