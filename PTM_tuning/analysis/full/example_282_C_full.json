  "explanation": "The correct answer requires recognizing that in a rhombus, the diagonals (AC and DB) are perpendicular. The student incorrectly selected sides AB and DC. \n\nThe error stems from a failure to apply the property that a rhombus's diagonals are perpendicular. The student likely focused on the sides being equal (a correct property) but incorrectly assumed adjacent sides must form right angles, as in a square. \n\nThis misconception is distinct from confusing parallel lines with equal sides, as the error involves misapplying perpendicularity to sides rather than diagonals. It also differs from not understanding dash markings, as the problem's figure wasn't described to include such markings. The error directly aligns with a lack of differentiation between rhombus and square properties regarding perpendicular lines.",
