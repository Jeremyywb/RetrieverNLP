  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3 \\times (-5) = -15 \\), where multiplying a positive and negative number yields a negative product.  \nStudent's calculation: \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\), treating \\(-5\\) as \\(5\\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly omitted the negative sign of \\(-5\\) during multiplication.  \nThis indicates they focused solely on the numerical value \\(5\\) and did not apply the rule that a positive multiplied by a negative results in a negative.  \nThis error aligns with ignoring the sign attached to the term \\(-5\\), rather than misapplying rules about multiple negatives or reversing sign conventions.  \nRelated misconceptions like believing two negatives yield a negative or always producing positives with multiple negatives do not apply here, as only one negative term exists.  \nThe flaw is isolated to mishandling the single negative sign during multiplication.",
