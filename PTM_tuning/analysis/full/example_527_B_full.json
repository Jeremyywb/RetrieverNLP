  "explanation": "The correct angle CEG is formed by vertices C-E-G, with E as the vertex and CE/EG as the sides. The student's answer FEC implies an angle with vertices F-E-C. This error occurred because the student selected F (a neighboring point on one arm of the angle) instead of G (the correct endpoint on the other arm). The misconception here stems from assuming angle notation requires using the geometrically closest labeled vertex for each side, rather than following the actual arms of the angle. This specifically differs from interior/exterior confusion (which would involve directionality) or vertical angle errors (which would require opposite rays). The student prioritized proximity over the actual angle structure when choosing labels.",
