  "explanation": "The correct solution converts 60% to \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\), subtracts the given \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) to find the missing part: \\(\\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{10}\\). \n\nThe student retained the original 60% value without conversion, directly writing it as the answer. This shows they misinterpreted the problem as requiring the same percentage to be repeated, rather than converting it to a fraction and calculating the remaining portion. \n\nThe error stems from treating the percentage as a fixed label rather than a proportional quantity to be manipulated. This aligns with the misconception of using the given percentage as the result without adjustment. \n\nIt differs from related misconceptions like believing percentages cannot be fractions (the student did not attempt conversion at all) or finding a percentage when asked for a fraction (the answer format was ignored, but the core error was retaining the percentage value itself).",
