  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Blue square area = 3\u00d73 = 9. Red square's side is the diagonal of a 2\u00d72 right triangle: \u221a(2\u00b2+2\u00b2) = \u221a8 \u2192 area = (\u221a8)\u00b2 = 8.\n\nStudent's error: Likely measured the red square's side as 4 units by adding horizontal and vertical grid spans (2+2) instead of using the Pythagorean theorem. This would yield an incorrect area calculation of 4\u00d74 = 16.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the diagonal's horizontal and vertical components as additive lengths rather than perpendicular legs of a right triangle. This directly stems from not recognizing how diagonal distances require geometric calculation.\n\nDistinction: This differs from confusing perimeter/area (which would involve comparing total boundary lengths) or visual estimation errors (which wouldn't involve explicit numerical miscalculations). The error specifically stems from misapplying linear measurement to diagonal distances.\n\nThe misconception caused the student to inflate the red square's dimensions through arithmetic addition instead of geometric relationship, creating an erroneous area comparison.",
