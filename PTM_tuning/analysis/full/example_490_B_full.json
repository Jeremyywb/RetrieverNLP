  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\), \\(15 + 1 = 16\\), resulting in \\(\\frac{16}{5}\\).  \nStudent's error: Directly placed the whole number \\(3\\) as the numerator over \\(5\\), yielding \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).  \n\nThe student treated the mixed number \\(3 \\frac{1}{5}\\) as though the whole number \\(3\\) could replace the fractional part's numerator \\(1\\), ignoring the requirement to convert the whole number into fifths first. This reflects a misunderstanding of how mixed numbers combine whole quantities and fractional parts multiplicatively, not additively.  \n\nThe error is distinct from merely adding the integer to the numerator (which would produce \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\)) or omitting the addition step after multiplying \\(3 \\times 5\\). Here, the student conflated the positional notation of mixed numbers with improper fractions, assuming the whole number directly represents the numerator.",
