  "explanation": "The correct solution starts by rewriting \\( k^2 = 4k \\) as \\( k(k - 4) = 0 \\), yielding solutions \\( k = 0 \\) or \\( k = 4 \\). \n\nThe student likely isolated \\( k = 4 \\) by dividing both sides by \\( k \\), resulting in \\( k = 4 \\). This step implicitly assumes \\( k \\neq 0 \\), thereby excluding the \\( k = 0 \\) solution. \n\nThe flaw arises from failing to recognize that dividing by \\( k \\) removes the \\( k = 0 \\) solution. This directly aligns with the misconception that 0 is not a valid solution, as the student neglected to test \\( k = 0 \\) independently or preserve it through proper factoring. \n\nThis differs from the \"incorrect factorisation\" misconception, as the equation was solvable via factoring, and from the \"constants in factorised form\" error, since the student didn't misinterpret the factored terms. The error specifically stems from dismissing \\( k = 0 \\) as a real solution.",
