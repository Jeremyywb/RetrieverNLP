  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) followed by \\(5 + 12 = 17\\).\n\nStudent's likely steps: \\(5 + 4 = 9\\), then \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\) (incorrect intermediate result). However, since the final answer was 60, this suggests an additional error: multiplying all terms together as \\(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 60\\).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student first violated operator priority by adding before multiplying, then compounded the error by treating the expression as entirely multiplicative. This reflects a dual failure to recognize both operator precedence and the distinct roles of addition/multiplication.\n\nDistinction: While the primary misconception focuses on prioritizing addition over multiplication, the erroneous leap to multiplying all terms indicates a deeper confusion about operator meaning beyond simple order of operations.\n\nKey connection: The initial misapplication of addition-first reasoning created an incorrect grouping (\\(5 + 4\\)), which the student then improperly extended to multiplicative combination with the remaining term.",
