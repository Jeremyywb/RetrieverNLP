  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Angles around a point sum to 360\u00b0, so 2y + y = 360 \u2192 3y = 360 \u2192 y = 120\u00b0.\n\nStudent's reasoning flaw: The student likely treated the two labeled angles as insufficient to determine the total sum, assuming missing angles not shown in the diagram.\n\nSpecific error: The student failed to recognize that angles around a point must include all adjacent angles meeting at that point. By omitting the requirement to account for all angles (even unlabeled ones) in the 360\u00b0 total, they incorrectly concluded the problem was underspecified.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly stems from not enforcing the angle sum rule for all angles around a point, including unlabeled ones. This aligns with the listed misconception about ignoring unlabeled angles when applying sum rules.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike confusing vertical angles or term collection errors, this mistake specifically involves misapplying the angle sum rule due to unaccounted angles, not algebraic missteps or misidentifying angle relationships.\n\nFinal confirmation: The student's \"not enough information\" response matches the failure to enforce the full 360\u00b0 sum requirement with the given variables, not a lack of knowledge about the sum itself.",
