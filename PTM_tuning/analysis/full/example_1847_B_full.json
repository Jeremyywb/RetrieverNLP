  "explanation": "The correct calculations show equivalent operations:  \nTom's subtraction \\(15 - 20 = -5\\) and Katie's addition \\(-5 + 20 = 15\\) both accurately represent the number line movement.\n\nThe student likely dismissed Tom's equation, interpreting \"15 - 20\" as invalid because they assume subtraction must yield a positive result when the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend. This caused them to reject the mathematically valid negative outcome (-5) as impossible. \n\nThey accepted Katie's equation because it aligns with adding a positive value to reach 15, not recognizing that subtraction and addition are inverse operations here. The error stems from restricting subtraction to cases where the first number is larger, ignoring integer results. \n\nThis directly connects to the misconception about subtracting larger numbers, not the inverse-operation relationship (since Katie's correct answer was accepted) or number-line misinterpretation (the arrow's start point was correctly identified as 15).",
