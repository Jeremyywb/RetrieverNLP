  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \nStarting with input \\( x \\), apply operations: \\( 2x - 5 = 23 \\). Solving for \\( x \\): add 5 to 23 (\\( 23 + 5 = 28 \\)), then divide by 2 (\\( 28 \u00f7 2 = 14 \\)). The star represents the output, which is \\( 23 \\).\n\nStudent's error: \nThe student incorrectly replaced the output (star) with the operation \\( \\times 2 \\), likely interpreting the star as a missing operation step rather than the final result.\n\nReasoning flaw: \nThe student misapplied the function machine's structure, confusing the output value with an operational step. They focused on the sequence of operations (\"double, subtract 5\") but failed to recognize that the star represents the numerical result after both operations are applied. This reflects a failure to distinguish between the process steps and the final output value.\n\nConnection to misconception: \nThis aligns with the misconception of not following the arrows through the function machine, as the student treated the output position as part of the operational sequence rather than the endpoint. It differs from \"reversing operations\" errors because the mistake here isn't about solving for the input but misidentifying the output's role.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: \nUnlike errors involving reversing operations or using inverses, this error stems from misinterpreting the function machine's graphical representation, specifically conflating operations with their resultant output.",
