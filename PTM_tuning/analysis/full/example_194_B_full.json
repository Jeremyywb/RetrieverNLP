  "explanation": "The correct mean calculation: (1+4+7+9+9)/5 = 30/5 = 6  \nThe student's answer: 9 (the mode)\n\nThe student identified 9 as the \"mean\" because it appears most frequently, equating central tendency with frequency rather than averaging. This shows they substituted mode for mean without performing any addition/division, indicating a fundamental disconnect between the concept of mean and its calculation. The error aligns with not knowing how to calculate the mean, as they defaulted to counting frequency instead of computing an average. This differs from median confusion (which would yield 7) or mode/range mixups, as no range calculation was attempted. The core failure was recognizing mean requires summing all values and dividing by their count.",
