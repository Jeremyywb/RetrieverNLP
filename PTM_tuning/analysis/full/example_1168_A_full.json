  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nHorizontal movement: -3 (W_x) - 2 (V_x) = -5 \u2192 left 5\nVertical movement: -1 (W_y) - 2 (V_y) = -3 \u2192 down 3\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nHorizontal movement: 2 - (-3) = 5, then likely subtracted 1 \u2192 left 4\nVertical movement: Correctly calculated -3\n\nThe student correctly calculated vertical movement but treated horizontal distance as 4 instead of 5. This suggests they found the numerical difference (5) but then reduced it by 1, likely due to counting the starting position as part of the movement distance. For example, they might have counted positions (2,1,0,-1,-2,-3) as 6 positions and incorrectly concluded 6-2=4 moves. This matches the misconception of including the starting number when calculating distance, where the student conflates coordinate positions with required movements. The error is distinct from direction mixing (which would preserve the correct magnitude) or basic subtraction errors (which would show incorrect arithmetic).\n\nThis specific flaw stems from misunderstanding how coordinate positions translate to movement units, not from misapplying subtraction or confusing directions.",
