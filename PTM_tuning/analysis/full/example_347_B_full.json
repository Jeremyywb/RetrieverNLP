  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( s = \\frac{1}{2}(2.9 + 3.5) \\times 5.2 = 16.64 \\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\( s = \\frac{1}{2}(2.9 + 3.5 + 5.2) = 5.8 \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly included the time value \\( 5.2 \\) in the summation for \\( (u+v) \\), treating it as a velocity term instead of a multiplier. This caused them to compute \\( \\frac{1}{2}(11.6) \\) instead of \\( \\frac{1}{2}(6.4) \\times 5.2 \\).  \n\nThe error stems from conflating distinct variables in the formula: \\( t \\) is not added to velocities but scales their average. This matches the misconception of adding all given numerical quantities indiscriminately, rather than recognizing their distinct roles in the equation.  \n\nIt differs from \"thinks multiplication means to add,\" as the student omitted the required multiplication by \\( t \\) entirely, not misapplying the operator. The error also isn't about unit confusion (speed + time) but about misplacing a variable in the formula.",
