  "explanation": "The transformation \\( y = -f(x) \\) negates each output value of \\( f(x) \\), converting \\( (x, y) \\) to \\( (x, -y) \\), which corresponds to a reflection over the x-axis. \n\nThe student incorrectly associated the negative sign in \\( -f(x) \\) with a diagonal reflection over \\( y = -x \\). This suggests they conflated transformations involving output values (vertical reflections) with those involving coordinate swaps (diagonal reflections). \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the rule for diagonal reflections, which typically require both variables to be negated or swapped (e.g., \\( y = -x \\) transforms \\( (a, b) \\) to \\( (-b, -a) \\)). By contrast, \\( -f(x) \\) only inverts y-values, making the x-axis the sole mirror line. \n\nThis distinguishes the error from related misconceptions like confusing vertical/horizontal reflections (e.g., \\( f(-x) \\)) or selecting \\( y = x \\) instead of \\( y = -x \\). The student specifically misattributed the effect of a vertical sign change to a diagonal symmetry.",
