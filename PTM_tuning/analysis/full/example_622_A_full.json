  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\)  \nStudent's calculation: \\( \\frac{3}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the original bar's divisions. The student likely counted the total visible segments (3 green subdivisions + 3 unmarked sections) as 6 parts, incorrectly making the whole bar \\(\\frac{3}{6}\\) instead of recognizing the green area as \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the whole. This caused them to multiply \\(\\frac{3}{6}\\) (the misidentified green portion) by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) (its subdivision), rather than multiplying the true fraction \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). \n\nThe flaw reflects a failure to distinguish hierarchical divisions: the green section's subdivision creates parts of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), not new denominators for the whole bar. This distinguishes it from equivalent fraction errors, as the mistake lies in structural interpretation of the diagram, not arithmetic manipulation of fractions.",
