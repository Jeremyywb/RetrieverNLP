  "explanation": "Correct calculation: A cube has 6 faces (front, back, left, right, top, bottom), each being a distinct flat surface.\n\nIncorrect reasoning: The student likely counted all 8 vertices (corners) of the cube instead of its flat surfaces. This occurred because they interpreted \"faces\" as referring to geometric vertices rather than planar surfaces.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student confused the definition of a face (a 2D surface) with the concept of vertices (0D points). This misapplication of geometric terminology directly substituted vertex count for face count.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error stems from conflating distinct components of 3D shapes, specifically misattributing the role of vertices as equivalent to faces. This differs from related edge/vertex confusion because the answer matches the total vertex count (8), not edge count (12).\n\nDistinction: Unlike errors involving visible-only elements or edge/vertex mixups, this mistake specifically substitutes one fundamental geometric term (vertices) for another (faces) in the problem's context.",
