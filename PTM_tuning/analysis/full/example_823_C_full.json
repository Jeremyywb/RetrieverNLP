  "explanation": "The correct calculation adds both the exclusive and overlapping regions of the \"Owns a Black Car\" set: \\( 15 \\) (intersection) + \\( 8 \\) (Black Car only) = \\( 23 \\). \n\nThe student likely interpreted the Venn diagram as showing only the standalone \"Black Car only\" value (\\( 8 \\)) as the total for black car owners, omitting the overlapping \\( 15 \\). \n\nThis error stems from misinterpreting the intersection as belonging solely to the other set (\"Owns a 4x4\") rather than recognizing it includes black car owners. The misconception caused the student to exclude the shared region when summing the total for one set. \n\nThis is distinct from confusing the intersection with the total of one set (which would involve mislabeling all of one set as the intersection) or miscalculating the union (which would require adding all three regions). The error specifically isolates the \"Black Car only\" region due to a failure to integrate the intersection into the requested set.",
