  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nUsing points (0,0) and (6,-4):\nSlope = (-4 - 0)/(6 - 0) = -4/6 = -2/3\n\nStudent's likely error:\nMiscalculated vertical/horizontal changes as -2 and 4 instead of -4 and 6:\nSlope = (-2)/4 = -1/2\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student reduced both coordinates proportionally (dividing x and y by 2) before applying the slope formula. This invalid pre-scaling distorted the actual rate of change. By altering the coordinate values first, they created an artificial ratio that didn't preserve the true relationship between \u0394y and \u0394x.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThis shows a fundamental misunderstanding of slope as an inherent property of the line that must be calculated directly from coordinate differences. Modifying individual coordinates before differencing destroys the proportional relationship required for accurate slope calculation.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis isn't a scale misread (coordinates weren't misidentified) nor intercept confusion. The error specifically stems from mishandling the slope calculation process after correctly identifying points.\n\nCritical misstep:\nTreating coordinates as independent values to simplify before differencing, rather than preserving their paired relationship to compute the true rate of change.",
