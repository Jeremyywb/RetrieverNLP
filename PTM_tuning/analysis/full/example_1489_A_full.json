  "explanation": "The correct answer identifies milliliters (ml) as invalid because perimeter requires length units. The student incorrectly selected centimeters (cm), a valid length unit. \n\nThe student likely reasoned that perimeter should use area units (e.g., cm\u00b2) due to conflating perimeter with area. This misconception caused them to reject cm as a valid unit, even though perimeter explicitly requires linear measurements. \n\nThis directly ties to the \"confuses perimeter and area\" misconception, as the error stems from expecting squared units rather than recognizing the mismatch with a volume unit (ml). It is distinct from misconceptions about mass or mile recognition, which do not involve unit dimensionality.",
