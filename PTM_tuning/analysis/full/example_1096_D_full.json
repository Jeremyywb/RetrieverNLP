  "explanation": "To find the midpoint, the x-coordinates are averaged: \\(\\frac{4+1}{2} = 2.5\\) and the y-coordinates: \\(\\frac{3 + (-5)}{2} = -1\\). The student likely calculated \\(4 + 1 = 5\\) and \\(3 + (-5) = -2\\) but refused to divide by 2, incorrectly concluding decimals are invalid. The flaw is assuming coordinates must be integers, rejecting the required division step. This directly matches the misconception that midpoints must be whole numbers, not merely forgetting to divide. It differs from rounding (which would produce an approximate integer) or finding differences (which would subtract coordinates instead of averaging). The error stems from misapplying midpoint formula prerequisites, not computational mistakes.",
