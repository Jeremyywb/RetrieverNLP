  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(0.03 \\times 12 = (3 \\times 12) \\div 100 = 36 \\div 100 = 0.36\\).\n\nStudent's likely steps: \n1. Multipled \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\)\n2. Incorrectly divided by \\(1000\\) (three decimal places) instead of \\(100\\) (two decimal places)\n3. Arrived at \\(36 \\div 1000 = 0.036\\)\n\nThe error stems from misapplying the power of 10 when converting back to a decimal. The student recognized \\(0.03\\) has two decimal places but erroneously treated it as requiring three decimal places in the final answer. This caused an extra division by 10, shrinking the result tenfold. \n\nThis matches the \"wrong power of 10\" misconception, not \"ignoring the decimal\" (which would yield \\(36\\)) or \"100 times smaller\" (which would produce \\(0.0036\\)). The specific miscount of decimal places distinguishes it from related errors.",
