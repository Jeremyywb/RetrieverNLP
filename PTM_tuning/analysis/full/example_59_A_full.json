  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(130\\% \\times 40 = 1.3 \\times 40 = 52\\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\(130\\% \\times 40 = 0.3 \\times 40 = 12\\).  \n\nThe student treated the full percentage value (130%) as if only the excess over 100% (30%) was relevant. This stems from interpreting percentages greater than 100% as instructions to use only the portion exceeding the \"whole,\" rather than recognizing that 130% represents scaling by 1.3.  \n\nThe error directly connects to misunderstanding percentages beyond 100%: the student subtracted 100% implicitly and applied the remaining 30% alone. This differs from misreading digit positions (which would require misparsing \"130\" as \"30\") or general multiplication errors. The flaw lies specifically in failing to process the full percentage as a unified multiplier.",
