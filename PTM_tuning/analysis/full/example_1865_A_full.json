  "explanation": "The correct calculation divides Q's corresponding length by P's: \\(11 \\div 3\\).  \nThe student reversed the division order, computing \\(3 \\div 11\\).  \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the direction of proportionality. To find the scale factor from \\(P\\) (original) to \\(Q\\) (enlarged), the ratio must be \\(\\frac{\\text{Q}}{\\text{P}}\\). The student incorrectly assumed the order of division doesn\u2019t affect proportionality, treating division as commutative.  \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception that the direction of enlargement doesn\u2019t dictate the division order. It does not match the \"larger divisor\" misconception, as \\(3 \\div 11\\) produces a smaller result despite the divisor (11) being larger than 3. The error is strictly about misaligning the enlargement direction with the division operation\u2019s numerator and denominator.",
