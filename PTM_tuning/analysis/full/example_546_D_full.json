  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 6 (frequency for 0 goals) + 7 (for 1) + 4 (for 2) + 3 (for 3) + 1 (for 4) = 21 matches  \nStudent's error: 0 (goals) + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10  \n\nThe student incorrectly summed the \"Goals scored\" values instead of their frequencies. They treated the first column as individual data points to be totaled rather than recognizing that the second column (\"Frequency\") represents the count of matches for each goal value. This indicates a failure to interpret the structure of a frequency table, where the frequency column directly provides the number of occurrences for each category.  \n\nThis error differs from simply adding all numbers in the table (which would produce a much larger sum) or confusing grouped totals. The specific misstep was prioritizing the variable column (goals) over the frequency column when calculating total matches, directly aligning with the stated primary misconception.",
