  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( [(6 \\times 4) + (6 \\times 3) + (4 \\times 3)] \\times 2 \\).\n\nStudent's calculation: \\( (6 \\times 4) \\times (6 \\times 3) \\times (4 \\times 3) \\).\n\nThe student correctly computed the area of each unique face (6\u00d74, 6\u00d73, 4\u00d73) but multiplied these three areas together instead of summing them. This replaces the required additive combination of face areas with multiplicative combination, resulting in an astronomically large value rather than a total area. The error stems from misapplying operations in the surface area formula: they treated the face areas as factors to multiply (as in volume calculations with three dimensions) rather than terms to sum before doubling. This differs from volume confusion (which would multiply all three dimensions once) or omitting the doubling step (which would sum without multiplying by 2). The core flaw is substituting multiplication for addition in the critical step of aggregating face areas.",
