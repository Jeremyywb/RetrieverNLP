  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{2}{7} + \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{2+1}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}\\).\n\nThe student's error: They retained the numerator of the first fraction (2) while keeping the denominator (7), resulting in \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\).\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student failed to combine the numerators, treating the addition as if it didn't alter the original fraction. This stems from a belief that fractions sharing a denominator don't require numerator adjustments during addition, effectively conflating the operation with mere identity.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error aligns with viewing fractions with identical denominators as static entities rather than quantities to be summed, bypassing the core rule of adding numerators while preserving the denominator.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike subtraction errors (which would yield \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\)) or denominator miscalculations, this mistake specifically preserves the original fraction's structure, indicating a failure to recognize the additive relationship between numerators.",
