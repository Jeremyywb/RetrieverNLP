  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows a cube number is \\( n^3 \\), where \\( 1 = 1^3 \\). The student incorrectly identified \\( 9 \\) as a cube number. \n\nThe error stems from treating multiplication by 3 as equivalent to cubing. If the student calculated \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\), they conflated multiplying by 3 (linear scaling) with exponentiation. This aligns with the misconception that cubing involves repeated addition or simple multiples of 3, rather than three-factor multiplication (e.g., \\( 3^3 = 27 \\), not \\( 9 \\)).\n\nThis flaw differs from confusing squaring and cubing (which would still require \\( 3^2 = 9 \\), but mislabeling it as a cube) or literally multiplying by 3 (which would produce \\( 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\), not 9). The error specifically reflects a misunderstanding of exponentiation as additive scaling.",
