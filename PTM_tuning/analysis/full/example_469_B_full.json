  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n\\(1 \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} = 1 \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nStudent's error:  \nLikely subtracted \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) directly from the whole number \\(1\\):  \n\\(1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\), ignoring the \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) in the mixed number entirely.\n\nReasoning flaw:  \nThe student treated the mixed number \\(1 \\frac{2}{3}\\) as separate components (\\(1\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)) and incorrectly applied subtraction only to the whole number. This bypassed the need to subtract fractions first and retain the whole number when possible.\n\nConnection to misconception:  \nBy isolating the whole number for subtraction instead of addressing the fractional part of the mixed number, the student demonstrated a failure to recognize that subtraction should first occur within the fractional components of the expression.\n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis is not a case of misapplying commutativity or simplifying mixed numbers incorrectly, but rather a failure to properly sequence operations and maintain the mixed number's structure during subtraction.",
