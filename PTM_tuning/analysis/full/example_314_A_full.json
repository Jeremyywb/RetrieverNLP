  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows \\(232 \\div 5 = 46.4\\) because \\(5 \\times 46 = 230\\), leaving \\(2\\) units remaining. To express the remainder as a decimal: \\(2 \\div 5 = 0.4\\). \n\nThe student likely performed \\(232 \\div 5 = 46\\) with a whole-number remainder of \\(2\\), then erroneously converted the remainder by treating the divisor \\(5\\) as \\(10\\), calculating \\(2 \\div 10 = 0.2\\). \n\nThis error stems from misapplying place value concepts: the student incorrectly associated the \"tenths\" place (base-10) with the divisor \\(5\\), rather than recognizing that the remainder must be divided by the original divisor to form a decimal. \n\nThe misconception directly links to misinterpreting how remainders translate to decimal fractions, distinct from errors like commutativity or fraction-denominator confusion. It specifically involves misaligning the divisor's role in decimal conversion with place value structure.",
