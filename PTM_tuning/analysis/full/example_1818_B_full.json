  "explanation": "The correct approach recognizes \\( \\frac{143}{2} \\) is valid as an improper fraction, while \\( \\frac{4.2}{9} \\) is invalid because fractions require integers in numerator/denominator. To fix Katie's answer, convert 4.2 to \\( \\frac{21}{5} \\), then divide by 9: \\( \\frac{21}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{7}{15} \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly accepted \\( \\frac{4.2}{9} \\) as valid. Their reasoning likely treated the decimal 4.2 as an acceptable numerator without converting it to an integer-based fraction first. This reflects a misunderstanding of fraction composition: decimals must be rewritten as integer numerators/denominators (e.g., 4.2 becomes \\( \\frac{21}{5} \\)) before forming a fraction. \n\nThis error aligns with the misconception that decimals can directly occupy the numerator of a fraction. It differs from the related misconception of placing decimals under a numerator of 1 (e.g., writing \\( \\frac{1}{4.2} \\) instead of \\( \\frac{10}{42} \\)) because the student retained the decimal in the numerator rather than the denominator.",
