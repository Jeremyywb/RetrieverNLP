  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1) Factor out 8bc: 24ab c\u00b2 \u00f7 8bc = 3ac, -16b\u00b2 c \u00f7 8bc = -2b \u2192 8bc(3ac - 2b)\n\nStudent's error:\n24ab c\u00b2 \u00f7 8bc = 3a, -16b\u00b2 c \u00f7 8bc = -2 \u2192 Student wrote 8bc(3a - 2)\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student correctly divided coefficients but failed to subtract exponents for variables during division. For 24ab c\u00b2 \u00f7 8bc:\n- c\u00b2 \u00f7 c = c^(2-1) = c (omitted)\nFor -16b\u00b2 c \u00f7 8bc:\n- b\u00b2 \u00f7 b = b^(2-1) = b (omitted)\n\nThis stems from misapplying exponent rules when variables are divided - specifically, treating c\u00b2/c as c\u2070=1 instead of c\u00b9, and b\u00b2/b as b\u2070=1 instead of b\u00b9. The error aligns with failing to track exponents during factorization, not merely ignoring variables or coefficients. Related misconceptions like \"ignores variables without explicit coefficients\" don't apply here, as the variables were initially identified as common factors but their exponents were mishandled.",
