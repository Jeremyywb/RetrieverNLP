  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows each term decreases by 8: 105 - 8 = 97, 97 - 8 = 89, 89 - 8 = 81. \n\nThe student likely calculated the common difference (8) correctly but stopped there, treating the difference itself as the next term instead of applying it to the last term (89). \n\nThis error stems from conflating the term-to-term rule with the actual next term. The student recognized the subtraction pattern but failed to execute the final step of subtracting 8 from 89. \n\nThis aligns with misinterpreting the question as asking for the rule rather than the term's value. It differs from other misconceptions like using inconsistent differences or misapplying a -1 pattern, as the student correctly identified the consistent -8 difference but misapplied it conceptually.",
