  "explanation": "The correct analysis recognizes that congruence requires both identical shape and size. Tom's rotated L-shapes maintain these properties, while Katie's shapes differ in size (wider upright section) despite having the same general form. \n\nThe student likely observed that Katie's shapes share the same L-shape structure but failed to recognize that the altered dimensions created a size discrepancy. This indicates they equated \"same shape\" with congruence, neglecting the requirement for identical measurements. \n\nThe error stems from isolating shape similarity as sufficient for congruence, omitting the size component. This directly aligns with misunderstanding the definition of congruence as requiring both properties, rather than confusing it with similarity (which allows proportional scaling). The student's focus on visual similarity of shape without verifying equal side lengths distinguishes this from misconceptions about similarity transformations.",
