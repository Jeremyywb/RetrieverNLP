  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{2}(2.9 + 3.5) \\times 5.2 = \\frac{1}{2}(6.4) \\times 5.2 = 3.2 \\times 5.2 = 16.64\\).\n\nStudent's calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{2}(2.9 + 3.5) + 5.2 = \\frac{1}{2}(6.4) + 5.2 = 3.2 + 5.2 = 8.4\\).\n\nThe student treated the time \\(t\\) as an additive term rather than a multiplicative factor. They correctly computed \\(\\frac{1}{2}(u+v)\\) but added \\(5.2\\) instead of multiplying it, violating the formula's structure. This reflects a failure to recognize that displacement requires scaling the average velocity by time duration. \n\nThe error is distinct from misinterpreting the multiplication symbol as addition in the formula itself (e.g., writing \\(\\frac{1}{2}(u+v) + t\\) instead of \\(\\frac{1}{2}(u+v)t\\)) or substitution errors, as the values \\(u, v, t\\) were correctly inserted. The core flaw was misapplying the operation between the averaged velocity term and time.",
