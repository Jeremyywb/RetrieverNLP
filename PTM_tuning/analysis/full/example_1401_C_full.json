  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes that \\(\\frac{a+b}{c}\\) and \\((a+b) \\div c\\) are identical because both expressions divide the entire sum \\(a+b\\) by \\(c\\), following proper grouping rules.\n\nA flawed reasoning might incorrectly parse the expressions as \\(a + \\frac{b}{c}\\) or \\(a + b \\div c\\), assuming division applies only to one term. For example, misapplying order of operations without grouping the numerator.\n\nThe student likely treated the division operator as non-grouping, assuming \\((a+b) \\div c\\) reduces to \\(a + (b \\div c)\\). This reflects a failure to recognize that parentheses in \\((a+b) \\div c\\) explicitly group the dividend, just as the fraction bar in \\(\\frac{a+b}{c}\\) does.\n\nThis directly stems from misunderstanding how division symbols and fraction notation enforce grouping. The error is distinct from mixing numerator/denominator placement (which would require swapped terms) or commutativity (which would involve reversing operands). The focus here is on grouping, not term order or operator properties.",
