  "explanation": "To calculate the distance between (4,10) and (9,2):  \n- Horizontal difference = 9-4 = 5  \n- Vertical difference = 10-2 = 8  \n- Distance = \u221a(5\u00b2 + 8\u00b2) = \u221a89 using a right-angled triangle.  \n\nThe student likely observed that the horizontal (5) and vertical (8) sides differ in length, and assumed the third side would also be unequal (making all sides different). However, they focused on side length classification (scalene) instead of recognizing that the triangle must be right-angled to apply Pythagoras' Theorem.  \n\nThis shows a failure to connect the geometric representation (using perpendicular legs to form a right triangle) with the required calculation method. While the triangle is indeed scalene, its angle classification (right-angled) is the critical feature for solving the problem.  \n\nThis error is distinct from confusing gradient/calculations or estimation issues - the student correctly identified triangle existence but misclassified its essential property for the task.",
