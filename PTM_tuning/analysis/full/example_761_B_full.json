  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n4 outcomes (first spinner) \u00d7 5 outcomes (second spinner) = 20 total outcomes.\n\nStudent's error:  \n4 outcomes + 5 outcomes = 9 total outcomes.\n\nThe student incorrectly summed the number of individual outcomes from each spinner rather than multiplying them. This reflects a failure to recognize that outcomes from independent events combine multiplicatively (each of the 4 first-spinner results pairs with all 5 second-spinner results). \n\nThe error directly stems from treating the problem as a union of separate outcomes (\"either spinner A or B can produce these values\") instead of a combination of simultaneous outcomes (\"spinner A and spinner B each produce one value\"). \n\nThis is distinct from confusing outcomes with unique numerical results (e.g., counting distinct numbers like 1-5) or misapplying probability rules (e.g., adding probabilities of separate events), as the error purely involves outcome enumeration, not numerical uniqueness or probability operations.",
