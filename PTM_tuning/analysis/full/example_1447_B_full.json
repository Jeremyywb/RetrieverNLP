  "explanation": "Correct steps:\n\\[\n2 = 3a - 4 \\\\\n2 + 4 = 3a \\quad \\text{(adding 4 to both sides)} \\\\\n6 = 3a \\\\\na = 2 \\quad \\text{(dividing by 3)}\n\\]\n\nStudent's likely steps:\n\\[\n2 = 3a - 4 \\\\\n2 - 4 = 3a \\quad \\text{(incorrectly subtracting 4)} \\\\\n-2 = 3a \\\\\na = -\\frac{2}{3} \\quad \\text{(dividing by 3)}\n\\]\n\nThe student failed to apply the inverse operation to eliminate the -4 term. Instead of reversing the subtraction by adding 4, they subtracted 4 again. This error in identifying inverse operations directly caused the sign reversal and incorrect division step. The flaw is distinct from order-of-operations issues, as the student recognized the need to isolate \\(3a\\) first, but misapplied the required operation. This matches the primary misconception rather than general linear equation errors, as the specific inverse operation (addition vs. subtraction) was misidentified.",
