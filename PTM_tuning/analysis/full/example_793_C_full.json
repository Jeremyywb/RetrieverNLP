  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the distance formula: \\(\\sqrt{(-5-1)^2 + (2-(-6))^2} = \\sqrt{(-6)^2 + 8^2}\\). \n\nThe student incorrectly applied the midpoint formula: \\(\\left(\\frac{1+(-5)}{2}, \\frac{-6+2}{2}\\right)\\). \n\nThe error stems from conflating the formulas for distance and midpoint. The student substituted averaging operations (addition followed by division) where coordinate differences (subtraction) and squaring were required. \n\nThis directly aligns with confusing the structural components of the two distinct formulas: midpoint computes an average of coordinates, while distance requires calculating differences to form a right triangle's legs. \n\nThe error is distinct from simply adding coordinates (as the student used division) or misapplying gradient formulas (which involve slope ratios, not coordinates averaging). \n\nThe misconception manifests as a formula substitution error rather than an arithmetic misstep within the correct formula.",
