  "explanation": "The correct calculation multiplies the unique prime factors in the left circle (11) with the shared primes in the intersection (2, 3): \\(11 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 66\\). \n\nThe student likely computed \\(11 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 132\\), treating the \"2\" in the right circle as an additional distinct prime factor for the star. \n\nThis error stems from misunderstanding that primes in the intersection are shared between both sets, not duplicated. The student incorrectly included the overlapping \"2\" twice (once in the intersection and again in the right circle) when constructing the star's prime factors. \n\nThis directly aligns with a failure to recognize that overlapping primes contribute to both sets simultaneously, not separately. It distinguishes from confusion about factors vs. prime factors, as the student correctly identified primes but misapplied set membership rules.",
