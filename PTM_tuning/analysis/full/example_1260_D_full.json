  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(0.07 \\times 100 = 7\\%\\).  \nStudent's error: \\(0.07 \\times 10 = 0.7\\), then writing it as \\(70\\%\\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly multiplied by 10 instead of 100 when converting the decimal. This caused them to shift the decimal point only one place (to tenths: 0.7) rather than two (to units: 7). Their action demonstrates confusion about the proportional relationship between decimals and percentages, where percentages require scaling by 100, not 10.  \n\nThis differs from \"adding a zero\" errors, which would produce \\(0.07 \u2192 007 = 7\\%\\). The error specifically stems from misapplying a 10x scale factor rather than altering digit placement through zero-addition or decimal-point removal.",
