  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n- Parallel lines require equal slopes (m). \n- Tom's lines: m=2 (both), so parallel.\n- Katie's lines: m=2 vs. m=3, so not parallel.\n\nStudent's Error:\n- Accepted Katie's claim because \\( y=2x+5 \\) and \\( y=3x+5 \\) share the same y-intercept (c=5).\n\nReasoning Flaw:\n- The student treated matching y-intercepts as sufficient for parallelism, rather than recognizing slope equality as the sole requirement. This directly caused them to incorrectly validate Katie's claim.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\n- The student correctly identified Tom's parallel lines (showing they understood slope equality), ruling out gradient confusion or ignorance. The error isolated to misapplying y-intercept relevance.",
