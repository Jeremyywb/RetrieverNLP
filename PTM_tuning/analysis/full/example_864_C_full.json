  "explanation": "To solve \\(5 - 0.5x = 6\\):  \n1. Subtract 5: \\(-0.5x = 1\\)  \n2. Multiply by \\(-2\\): \\(x = -2\\).  \n\nThe student likely saw the constant term \\(5\\) in the equation and directly equated it to \\(x = 5\\), ignoring the \\(-0.5x\\) term and the equality to \\(6\\). This reflects a misapplication of algebraic isolation, where they treated the standalone constant as the solution rather than solving for \\(x\\).  \n\nThe error stems from conflating the equation's constant term with the variable's value, bypassing proper equation-solving steps. This distinguishes it from misconceptions like confusing intercepts, as the error lies in misaligning terms within the equation structure itself, not graphical misinterpretations.",
