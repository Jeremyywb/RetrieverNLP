  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n36 \u2264 4(5n -1)\n9 \u2264 5n -1   (divided both sides by 4)\n10 \u2264 5n     (added 1 to both sides)\n2 \u2264 n       (divided both sides by 5)\n\nStudent's likely steps:\n36 \u2264 4(5n -1)\n9 \u2265 5n -1    (incorrectly reversed inequality when dividing by 4)\n10 \u2265 5n      (added 1 to both sides)\n2 \u2265 n        (divided by 5 without reversal)\n\nThe student mistakenly reversed the inequality when dividing both sides by 4, a positive number. This specific reversal directly caused the final answer's direction to flip. The error stems from believing division by any coefficient (even positive) requires inequality reversal. This distinguishes it from notation misunderstandings (which would affect interpretation of \u2264/\u2265 symbols) or commutative errors in subtraction (unused here). The reversal at the division step precisely matches the misconception about direction changes with positive coefficients.",
