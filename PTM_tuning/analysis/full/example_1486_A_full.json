  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires aligning decimal points:\n```\n 0.70\n+0.54\n------\n```\nThe student incorrectly aligned digits as:\n```\n 0.7\n+0.54\n------\n```\nwith 7 above 4 and decimal point above 5. This occurs because they anchored digits to the rightmost numeral instead of the decimal point, treating 0.7 as having two decimal places (forcing the 7 into the hundredths place). The error stems from prioritizing digit position over place value alignment, causing tenths (7) to incorrectly combine with hundredths (4). This specifically demonstrates decimal misalignment rather than general place value confusion or missing zero insertion, as the error pattern shows systematic right-justification of digits independent of their actual positional values.",
