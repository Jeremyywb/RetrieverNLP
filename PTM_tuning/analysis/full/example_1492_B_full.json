  "explanation": "The correct interpretation recognizes that probability 0 indicates an event cannot occur in any circumstance. The student incorrectly labeled this as \"Unlikely,\" suggesting they interpret 0 probability as representing an extremely low chance rather than impossibility. \n\nThe flaw stems from misinterpreting the numerical probability value: The student treats 0 as merely indicating absence of observed occurrences (equivalent to multiple failures) rather than representing logical impossibility. This directly connects to confusing empirical frequencies (where 0/100 trials might be considered \"unlikely\") with theoretical probability (where P=0 is a definitive mathematical statement).\n\nThis misconception differs from thinking probabilities can exceed 1 (which deals with range violations) or requiring equal outcomes (which concerns distribution assumptions). The error specifically involves misattributing meaning to the numerical probability value itself rather than other aspects of probability theory.",
