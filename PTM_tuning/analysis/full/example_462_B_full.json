  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n4(3x-2) = 2(6x-8)\n12x - 8 = 12x - 16  \n12x - 12x - 8 = -16  \n-8 = -16 (contradiction \u2192 no solution)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nLikely canceled 12x terms and incorrectly concluded:  \n12x - 8 = 12x - 16  \n-8 = -16 \u2192 \"solve for x\" \u2192 x=0\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student treated the contradiction -8=-16 as an equation solvable for x rather than recognizing it indicates no solution. They substituted x=0 to force a numerical answer despite the variables canceling completely.\n\nConnection to misconception:  \nWhen variables cancel, the student defaulted to x=0 instead of analyzing the remaining constants. This matches the primary misconception of providing x=0 when no solution exists.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:  \nThe error didn't stem from incorrect expansion (they likely distributed correctly to reach 12x terms) or operational inverses. The key issue was misinterpreting the contradiction as requiring x=0 rather than recognizing impossibility.",
