  "explanation": "The correct way to verbalize \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) is \"three fifths,\" where the numerator is stated as a cardinal number and the denominator as an ordinal. The student answered \"three point five,\" which corresponds to writing 3.5. This error arises from misinterpreting the fraction bar as a decimal point rather than a division symbol. Specifically, the student placed a decimal between the numerator (3) and denominator (5), converting \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) into 3.5 instead of performing the division \\( 3 \\div 5 = 0.6 \\). This directly aligns with the misconception of inserting a decimal between numerator and denominator, not merely using the denominator after the decimal (which would produce 0.5, not 3.5). The error reflects confusion about fraction notation rather than decimal conversion methods.",
