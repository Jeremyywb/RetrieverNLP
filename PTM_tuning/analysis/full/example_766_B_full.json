  "explanation": "The correct total frequency calculation is: 4 (for 0 pets) + 6 (for 1 pet) + 3 (for 2 pets) + 2 (for 3 pets) + 5 (for 4 pets) = 20.\n\nThe student likely counted the number of rows in the table (5 distinct number-of-pets categories) rather than summing the frequency values. This indicates they conflated the count of variable classes with the total observations. \n\nThe error stems from interpreting the table's row count as representing total participants instead of recognizing that each row's frequency must be aggregated. This matches the misconception where students treat table rows as individual data points rather than frequency counts.\n\nThis differs from related errors like adding the variable column (which would sum 0+1+2+3+4=10) or confusing cumulative frequency, neither of which produce the answer 5. The specific confusion aligns with counting table rows instead of frequency values.",
