  "explanation": "Correct Calculation: To find 40%, divide by 100 (to get 1%) then multiply by 40, equivalent to multiplying by 0.4. Katie's method simplifies this: 40% = 2/5, so divide by 5 (yielding 20%) and multiply by 2.\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation: The student followed Tom's method: divide by 100 (e.g., for 200: 200 \u00f7 100 = 2) and multiply by 4 (2 \u00d7 4 = 8), erroneously yielding 8 instead of the correct 80 for 40% of 200.\n\nSpecific Flaw: The student treated the percentage value (40) as a discrete multiplier (4) after division by 100, failing to recognize that 40% requires multiplying by 40/100 = 0.4. This reflects a misunderstanding of percentage-to-decimal conversion.\n\nMisconception Link: The error stems from conflating the percentage's numerical value (40) with the scaling factor required (0.4). Dividing by 100 isolates 1%, but multiplying by 4 instead of 40 misrepresents the percentage proportion.\n\nDistinction from Related Errors: Unlike errors involving division by 10 or the percentage itself, this mistake specifically misapplies the percentage value after correct division by 100, highlighting a flawed conversion step rather than incorrect divisor choice.",
