  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes that \\( \\sqrt[4]{16} = 16^{1/4} \\), and since \\( 2^4 = 16 \\), the answer is \\( 2 \\). The student incorrectly concluded \\( 16 \\), likely interpreting the fourth root operation as leaving the original number unchanged rather than applying the inverse of raising to the fourth power. \n\nThis stems from conflating the presence of the root index (4) with the result itself, treating the root symbol as a passive label rather than an operation requiring exponentiation. The error directly aligns with confusing the exponent (the \\( 1/4 \\) in \\( 16^{1/4} \\)) with the final value, bypassing the necessary computation. \n\nUnlike related misconceptions (e.g., multiplying/dividing by the index or misapplying arithmetic to the exponent), the student\u2019s error reflects a fundamental disconnect between the root\u2019s definition and its effect on the base number.",
