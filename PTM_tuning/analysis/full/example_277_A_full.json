  "explanation": "To solve \\(\\frac{x}{3} + 4 = 5\\), the correct steps are:  \n1. Subtract 4: \\(\\frac{x}{3} = 1\\)  \n2. Multiply by 3: \\(x = 3\\).  \n\nThe student instead:  \n1. Multiplied by 3 first: \\(x + 12 = 15\\)  \n2. Subtracted 4: \\(x = 11\\).  \n\nThe error stems from applying inverse operations in the same order as the original function steps (division then addition), rather than reversing the order. The misconception caused them to invert operations individually (division \u2192 multiplication, addition \u2192 subtraction) but retain the sequence, violating the requirement to reverse the order of operations when solving equations. This distinguishes the error from related issues like input/output confusion, as the flaw lies specifically in misapplying inverse operation sequencing, not misinterpreting function machine flow.",
