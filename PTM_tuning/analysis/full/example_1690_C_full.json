  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Each friend receives \\( \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} \\) pounds. This represents the fractional share of the total \u00a36, as \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) is equivalent to dividing \u00a36 into 8 equal parts.\n\nStudent's error: The student likely interpreted the denominator as the total monetary amount (\u00a36) rather than the number of equal parts (8). They wrote \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\), suggesting they viewed each friend as receiving \"1 part\" out of a misidentified \"6 total parts.\"\n\nSpecific flaw: The student misapplied the fraction structure by using the total money value (\u00a36) as the denominator instead of the number of recipients (8). This conflates the quantity being divided (numerator) with the total reference amount (denominator).\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: Unlike confusion between part/whole or misplacing the fraction as \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), this error specifically substitutes the total monetary value for the denominator rather than the number of partitions. It directly misattributes what defines the \"whole\" in the fraction.\n\nThe misconception caused the student to invert the relationship between the division operation (\\( 6 \\div 8 \\)) and fraction representation, producing an inverted denominator based on total currency instead of equal shares.",
