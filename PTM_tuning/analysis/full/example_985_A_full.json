  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nTo solve \u25a1 - 1.534 = 2.7, add both sides: \u25a1 = 2.7 + 1.534 = 4.234\n\nStudent's error:\nThey subtracted 1.534 from 2.7: 2.7 - 1.534 = 1.166\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student treated the minuend (whole) as the difference (part), reversing the required operation. They incorrectly assumed the unknown value represented the result of subtracting 1.534 from 2.7 rather than recognizing it as the starting value requiring addition.\n\nMisconception link:\nThis shows confusion between the roles of minuend and difference in subtraction equations. The student solved for (difference - subtrahend) instead of (subtrahend + difference) needed to find the minuend.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike general inverse operation confusion (which might involve multiplication/division errors), this specifically misapplies subtraction's component relationships. The error stems from misassigning the unknown's role in the equation structure rather than operational reversal alone.\n\nKey focus:\nThe student failed to recognize that when the minuend is missing, the solution requires combining the known values through addition - not preserving their original subtraction relationship.",
