  "explanation": "The correct equation \\( t^{2} = -27 \\) has no real solutions because squaring any real \\( t \\) yields a non-negative result. The student incorrectly identified \\( t - 27 = -27 \\), which simplifies to \\( t = 0 \\), a valid real solution. \n\nThe student likely solved \\( t - 27 = -27 \\) correctly to \\( t = 0 \\) but erroneously concluded that \\( t = 0 \\) implies \"no solution\" rather than recognizing it as a valid answer. This aligns with the misconception that equations resulting in \\( 0 \\) are unsolvable, conflating a legitimate solution with the absence of solutions. \n\nThis differs from related misconceptions about square roots or perfect squares, as the error stems from misinterpreting \\( 0 \\) as invalid, not from algebraic or square-root reasoning.",
