  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3600 \\div 60 = 60 \\) minutes, then \\( 60 \\div 60 = 1 \\) hour.\n\nStudent's calculation: \\( 3600 \\div 100 = 36 \\).\n\nThe student divided by 100 instead of performing two sequential divisions by 60. They likely treated the conversion as a single step using an incorrect factor (100) rather than accounting for two unit transitions (seconds \u2192 minutes \u2192 hours). This directly stems from misapplying division with an erroneous conversion rate, bypassing the intermediate step of minutes. \n\nDistinct from \"forgets to include hours\" (which would yield 60) or \"thinks 30 seconds/minute\" (which would produce 2 hours), this error reflects a flawed single-division approach with a mismatched divisor.",
