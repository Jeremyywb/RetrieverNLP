  "explanation": "The correct solution sums the ratio parts: \\(2 + 5 = 7\\), then expresses Kate's share as \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\). \n\nThe student likely took the first number in the ratio (2) as the numerator and the second number (5) as the denominator directly, arriving at \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\). \n\nThis error stems from treating the ratio terms as direct components of a fraction (2 over 5) rather than recognizing that fractions require parts to be compared to the total (2 parts out of 2+5 total). \n\nThe misconception conflates the structure of ratios (a comparison of parts) with fractions (a part-whole relationship), skipping the critical step of calculating the total parts. \n\nThis differs from related errors like inverting the ratio (which would involve swapping terms) or misunderstanding how ratios scale, as the core issue here is failing to compute the total parts before forming the fraction.",
