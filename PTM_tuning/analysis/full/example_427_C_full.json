  "explanation": "Correct calculation using tangent points (2,31) and (8,55):\nGradient = (55 - 31)/(8 - 2) = 24/6 = 4\n\nStudent's error likely involved misapplying velocity at t=6:\nIf they calculated 47/6 \u2248 7.83, but their answer 7.66 suggests they may have used 46/6 \u2248 7.67 instead. This implies they either misread the graph or incorrectly associated gradient with v/t at a single point.\n\nThe flaw stems from treating the instantaneous rate of change as velocity divided by time rather than computing the slope of the tangent. This directly conflates the value of the function with its derivative. \n\nThis differs from \"sum of y/sum of x\" errors (which would yield 133/16\u22488.31) and distinguishes it from average rate miscalculations, as the tangent points were explicitly provided for gradient calculation.",
