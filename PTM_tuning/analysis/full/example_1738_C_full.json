  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n212\u00b0 is greater than 180\u00b0 and less than 360\u00b0, making it a reflex angle.\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\nThe student likely subtracted 212\u00b0 from 360\u00b0 (360 - 212 = 148\u00b0) and misclassified 148\u00b0 as acute.\n\nSpecific Reasoning Flaw:\nThe student treated the reflex angle as its supplementary counterpart (360\u00b0 - angle) but then misapplied angle classification rules. After calculating 148\u00b0, they incorrectly labeled it \"acute\" instead of \"obtuse.\"\n\nConnection to Misconception:\nThe error originated from reducing the reflex angle to its supplementary angle (primary misconception). The subsequent misclassification of 148\u00b0 as acute (confusing obtuse/acute) is secondary but not the root cause.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nThis differs from pure \"confuses obtuse/acute\" errors because the student first altered the angle measurement itself via the 360\u00b0 assumption, which is the core flaw.",
