  "explanation": "The correct calculation is \\( 360 - 180 - 45 = 135 \\), subtracting both known degrees from the total. The student computed \\( 360 - 180 + 45 = 225 \\), effectively adding 45 instead of subtracting it. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying left-to-right operations without recognizing that both terms (180 and 45) must be subtracted from 360. The student likely processed the first subtraction (\\( 360 - 180 \\)) correctly but then treated the second value as a positive addition (\\( 180 + 45 \\)) instead of a subtraction (\\( 180 - 45 \\)). This reflects a failure to interpret the problem as requiring consecutive subtractions for the remaining categories, despite no explicit brackets. \n\nThe error aligns with the misconception of strictly following left-to-right order without adjusting for the implied negative signs in the context. It differs from related misconceptions like right-to-left subtraction (e.g., \\( 360 - (180 + 45) \\)) or misreading the problem entirely, as the student correctly identified the need for subtraction initially but misapplied the second operation.",
