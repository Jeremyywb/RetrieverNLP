  "explanation": "The correct approach identifies parallel lines through equal slopes. The given line \\( y = 3x + 5 \\) has a slope of 3. The correct answer \\( y = 4 - 3x \\) (equivalent to \\( y = -3x + 4 \\)) has a slope of -3, making it non-parallel.\n\nThe student incorrectly selected \\( y = 3x - 2 \\), which has the same slope (3) as the original line and is therefore parallel. Their error stems from misidentifying the gradient: they likely interpreted the constant term (-2) as the slope instead of the coefficient of \\( x \\). This caused them to incorrectly conclude the line wasn't parallel due to differing constants, not slopes. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception that \\( c \\) (the y-intercept) represents the gradient in \\( y = mx + c \\). Unlike related errors involving sign reversals or term-switching, the student focused on the wrong numerical value entirely, mistaking the intercept for the slope.",
