  "explanation": "Correct expansion:\n1. Multiply first two brackets: (p+8)(p+2) = p\u00b2 + 10p + 16\n2. Multiply result by (p+1):\n   - (p\u00b2)(p) = p\u00b3\n   - (p\u00b2)(1) = p\u00b2\n   - (10p)(p) = 10p\u00b2\n   - (10p)(1) = 10p\n   - (16)(p) = 16p\n   - (16)(1) = 16\n3. Combine like terms: p\u00b3 + 11p\u00b2 + 26p + 16 (4 terms)\n\nStudent's likely error:\n- After multiplying (p\u00b2 + 10p + 16) by (p+1), they incorrectly combined the 11p\u00b2 and 26p terms into a single term (e.g., treating p\u00b2 and p as like terms).\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student assumed terms with different exponents (p\u00b2 and p) could be combined. This violates the requirement that like terms must have identical variables and exponents. The misconception caused them to reduce four valid terms to three by merging unlike terms.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis is not a failure to multiply all brackets (which would produce missing terms) but a misapplication of simplification rules. The error specifically stems from conflating terms with distinct powers of p, not from incomplete multiplication.",
