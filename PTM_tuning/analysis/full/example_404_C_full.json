  "explanation": "The correct analysis shows Katie's expression \\( 3-\\frac{n}{3} \\) simplifies to \\( -\\frac{1}{3}n + 3 \\), a linear form, while Tom's \\( (n+1)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 \\) is cubic. The student likely assumed Tom's expression was linear because \\( (n+1) \\) is linear, failing to recognize that cubing a linear term produces a cubic sequence. This stems from conflating operations on the term's components (e.g., adding constants) with exponents altering the degree. The error directly aligns with misjudging sequence types due to improper handling of exponents, distinct from misconceptions about fractions or coefficients. For Katie\u2019s sequence, the student correctly ignored the negative coefficient and fractional term, showing their error was isolated to misapplying polynomial degrees, not rejecting fractions or negatives.",
