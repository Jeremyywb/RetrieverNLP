  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Combine coefficients (3) and apply exponent rules to like variables: \\(3 \\times l^{3} \\times g^{2} = 3g^{2}l^{3}\\).\n\nStudent's incorrect version: \\(3ggl^{3}\\) shows they recognized repeated multiplication for \\(l\\) (writing \\(l^{3}\\)) but treated \\(g \\times g\\) as separate terms instead of applying the same exponent rule.\n\nThe error stems from inconsistent application of index notation. The student understood that repeated multiplication of \\(l\\) should become an exponent but failed to extend this logic to \\(g\\), treating its repetition as separate factors rather than a single squared term.\n\nThis matches the primary misconception: They partially applied index laws (to \\(l\\)) but not universally (to \\(g\\)), indicating an incomplete grasp of when and how exponents replace repeated multiplication. \n\nIt differs from related misconceptions about commutativity or omitting multiplication symbols, as the error specifically involves variable exponentiation rules rather than term ordering or notation conventions.",
