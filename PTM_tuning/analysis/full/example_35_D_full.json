  "explanation": "To convert 0.6 to a percentage, multiply by 100:  \n\\(0.6 \\times 100 = 60\\%\\).  \n\nThe student likely performed:  \n\\(0.6 \\div 100 = 0.006\\%\\).  \n\nThe error stems from moving the decimal point two places to the *left* instead of the required two places to the *right*. This converts the decimal to a smaller value (division by 100) rather than scaling it up to a percentage (multiplication by 100).  \n\nThe misconception directly corresponds to misplacing the decimal direction during conversion, not merely dividing by 1000 or inverting multiplication/division. While dividing by 1000 would produce a smaller result (0.0006%), the student's answer matches the magnitude of dividing by 100, confirming decimal misplacement as the flaw.",
