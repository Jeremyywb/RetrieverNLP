  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Jo: 99.96 rounded to 1 significant figure \u2192 first significant digit is 9 (tens place), next digit 9 \u22655 \u2192 round up \u2192 100\n- Paul: 99.96 rounded to 1 decimal place \u2192 first decimal digit is 9 (tenths place), next digit 6 \u22655 \u2192 round up \u2192 100.0 (must preserve one decimal place)\n\nStudent's error:\n- Incorrectly concluded Paul's answer (100) was valid by rounding 99.96 \u2192 100 without maintaining the decimal place\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student treated rounding to one decimal place as equivalent to rounding to the nearest integer. They failed to recognize that rounding to one decimal place requires retaining one digit after the decimal point (100.0), even when the tenths digit becomes zero. This caused them to discard the decimal precision entirely, conflating it with rounding to zero decimal places.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThe error is specifically about mishandling decimal place requirements (producing an integer result), not confusing significant figures with decimal places. While similar to \"rounds to the nearest integer,\" the core issue is misapplying the decimal place rule, not misidentifying significant figures.",
