  "explanation": "To solve \\( x^2 - 1 = 15 \\):  \nCorrect steps:  \n\\( x^2 = 16 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm4 \\). Both \\( 4 \\) and \\( -4 \\) are valid.  \n\nThe student likely reasoned:  \n1. Substituted \\( x = 4 \\): \\( 4^2 - 1 = 15 \\) (correct).  \n2. Tried \\( x = -4 \\): Assumed \\( (-4)^2 = -16 \\), leading to \\( -16 - 1 = -17 \\neq 15 \\).  \n\nThe flaw lies in treating \\( (-4)^2 \\) as \\( -(4^2) = -16 \\), instead of \\( (-4) \\times (-4) = 16 \\). This misapplies the order of operations, conflating squaring a negative with squaring-then-negating.  \n\nThis directly stems from misunderstanding how exponentiation interacts with negatives, not merely forgetting squared results are non-negative. Unlike general positivity misconceptions, the error specifically miscomputes \\( (-a)^2 \\), not just its sign.  \n\nThe student rejected \\( -4 \\) due to this misapplication, dismissing Katie\u2019s answer unnecessarily.",
