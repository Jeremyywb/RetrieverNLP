  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n\\( \\frac{18}{30} = \\frac{18 \\div 6}{30 \\div 6} = \\frac{3}{5} \\), where 6 is the GCD of 18 and 30.\n\nStudent's error:  \nFailed to recognize that 18 and 30 share 6 as a common factor. They likely noticed both are even but only checked divisibility by 2 once, resulting in \\( \\frac{9}{15} \\), then stopped without verifying if 9 and 15 share another common factor (3).\n\nReasoning flaw:  \nThe student treated simplification as a single-step process rather than iteratively applying common factors. They correctly divided by 2 but didn\u2019t decompose the resulting numerator (9) and denominator (15) further to find the remaining common factor of 3. This aligns with failing to fully simplify by exhausting all shared factors.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:  \nThe error stems from incomplete simplification rather than a total failure to factor (e.g., the student recognized the initial factor of 2 but didn\u2019t persist). It differs from not recognizing simplification is possible at all, as partial simplification was implicitly attempted.",
