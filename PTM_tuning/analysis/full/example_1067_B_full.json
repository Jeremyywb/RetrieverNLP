  "explanation": "The correct calculation counts each distinct spinner section as a possible outcome: 6 sections \u2192 6 outcomes.  \nThe student likely reasoned: \"Labels are 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5 \u2192 unique numbers are 1, 3, 5 \u2192 3 outcomes.\"  \n\nThe error stems from treating unique label values as equivalent to distinct outcomes.  \nThe spinner's physical sections (not label uniqueness) define possible outcomes. Each section is equally likely regardless of label repetition.  \n\nThis directly aligns with \"confuses number of unique results with total outcomes,\" as the student conflated label diversity with outcome count.  \nIt differs from \"confuses number of choices with positions\" because the student correctly identified 6 sections visually but misapplied label analysis instead of positional counting.",
