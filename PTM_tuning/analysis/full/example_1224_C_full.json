  "explanation": "Correct reasoning: When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles (e.g., angles in matching positions) are equal. Co-interior angles (allied angles) between the parallel lines sum to 180\u00b0, not equal.\n\nStudent's error: The student equated both angle relationships, assuming \"equal\" applies to both. They likely conflated the distinct properties of these angle pairs, applying equality (which only holds for corresponding angles) to co-interior angles instead of recognizing their supplementary relationship.\n\nSpecific flaw: The error stems from misattributing the equality property that defines corresponding angles to co-interior angles. This directly maps to confusing these two angle types' fundamental properties.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: This isn't a general belief that \"all angles are equal\" (which would also affect alternate angles) nor a miscalculation of supplementary relationships - it's specifically swapping the equality/supplementary attributes between co-interior and corresponding angles.\n\nKey evidence: The student validated Tom's claim about co-interior angles being equal, which requires a direct misapplication of the corresponding angles' property to the wrong angle pair.",
