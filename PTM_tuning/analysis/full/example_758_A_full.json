  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes that the 78\u00b0 angle and angle \\( t \\) are corresponding angles formed by parallel lines and a transversal, making them equal: \\( t = 78^\\circ \\).\n\nThe student likely treated the 78\u00b0 angle and \\( t \\) as co-interior angles, adding them to reach 90\u00b0: \\( 78^\\circ + t = 90^\\circ \\rightarrow t = 12^\\circ \\).\n\nThe error stems from misclassifying the relationship between the angles and assuming they sum to 90\u00b0, a misunderstanding of co-interior angle properties. The angles are not co-interior (they lie on opposite sides of the transversal relative to the parallel lines), and co-interior angles actually sum to 180\u00b0, not 90\u00b0. This distinguishes the error from related misconceptions like confusing corresponding angles (which sum to 180\u00b0 if misapplied) or miscalculating angles on a straight line (which would involve adjacent angles, not these two). The specific 12\u00b0 result aligns uniquely with an erroneous 90\u00b0 co-interior sum.",
