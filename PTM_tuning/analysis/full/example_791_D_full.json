This shows a failure to recognize that remainders must be combined with subsequent digits through place value before continuing division.\n\nDistinguishing factors:\nThis differs from place value errors (which would involve digit positioning) or right-left calculation (which would reverse quotient digits). The error specifically stems from misapplying the remainder's role in the algorithm.\n\nMisconception link:\nThe student prematurely used the remainder as a quotient digit instead of maintaining it as part of the ongoing dividend, interrupting the standard division process.",
