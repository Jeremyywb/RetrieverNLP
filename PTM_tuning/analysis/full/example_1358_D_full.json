  "explanation": "The correct calculation sums the ratio parts (5 + 1 = 6 total parts) and identifies water as \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\). The student likely reasoned that ratios alone cannot determine fractions without absolute quantities, failing to recognize that ratios inherently define proportional parts. Their misconception caused them to treat \"5:1\" as insufficient data rather than a complete proportional relationship. This directly connects to misinterpreting how ratios encode part-to-whole relationships, not merely part-to-part. Unlike mixing up total/part (which would involve incorrect addition) or order confusion (switching numerator/denominator), this error stems from rejecting the ratio's sufficiency to form fractions. The student's flawed premise was that fractions require explicit total quantities rather than deriving them from ratio sums.",
