  "explanation": "To find a line perpendicular to \\( y = 3x - 2 \\), the slope must be the negative reciprocal of 3, which is \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\). The student selected \\( y = 3x + 7 \\), which retains the original slope of 3. \n\nThe student incorrectly assumed that maintaining the same slope (3) would satisfy the condition for perpendicularity. This suggests they conflated the definitions of parallel and perpendicular lines, treating identical slopes as sufficient for perpendicularity. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception that \"perpendicular\" describes lines that are parallel, rather than recognizing that perpendicularity requires slopes to multiply to \\(-1\\). The error is distinct from misconceptions about sign changes or reciprocal slopes alone, as the student preserved the original slope entirely.",
