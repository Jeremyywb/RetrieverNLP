  "explanation": "The correct three-letter notation places the vertex (G) between the two other points (E and H), forming \\( \\mathrm{EGH} \\). The student wrote \"EGCE,\" placing the vertex at the last letter (E) and including an extra point (C). \n\nThe error arises from the belief that the vertex corresponds to the final letter in the sequence, leading the student to incorrectly designate E as the vertex instead of G. This directly aligns with the misconception that the angle's vertex is determined by the last letter. The inclusion of \"C\" suggests additional confusion about which points form the angle, but the core flaw is the misplacement of the vertex. This distinguishes the error from related misconceptions about order or single-letter labeling, as the key issue is the faulty association of the vertex with the sequence's end.",
