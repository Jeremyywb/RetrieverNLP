  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Order numbers: 0.002, 0.02, 0.2, 2\n2. Identify middle pair: 0.02 and 0.2\n3. Calculate average: (0.02 + 0.2)/2 = 0.22/2 = 0.11\n\nStudent's error:\nStopped at step 2 sum: 0.02 + 0.2 = 0.22 (without dividing by 2)\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student correctly identified the two central values but treated their sum as the final answer rather than computing their average. This shows a failure to recognize that the median for an even-numbered dataset requires averaging the middle pair. The misconception stems from not distinguishing between summing values for totals versus averaging them for central tendency.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis differs from decimal addition errors (which would involve misaligned digits) or calculating the full dataset's mean. The error specifically targets misunderstanding median's definition, not computational errors in arithmetic.\n\nKey mathematical gap:\nConfusing summation with averaging in the median's definition for even counts, despite correct ordering and identification of central values.",
