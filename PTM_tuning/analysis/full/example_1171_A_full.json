  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n19 \u00f7 5 = 3 with remainder 4 \u2192 \\(3 \\frac{4}{5}\\)\n\nStudent's incorrect steps:\n19 \u00f7 5 = 4 (incorrect quotient)  \nRemainder calculated as 19 - (5\u00d74) = -1 \u2192 treated as 1 \u2192 \\(4 \\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\nSpecific reasoning flaw:\nThe student chose 4 as the quotient instead of 3, ignoring that 5\u00d74=20 exceeds 19. This caused a negative remainder they incorrectly interpreted as 1. The error stems from selecting an oversized quotient digit during division, a direct manifestation of carrying the wrong digit in the written division process.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThis is not confusion between remainder/quotient (which would swap 3 and 4) nor using the tens digit (which would produce 1). The error specifically occurs in the division algorithm's digit selection step.",
