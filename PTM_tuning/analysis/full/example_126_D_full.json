  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nTotal height = 14 cm\nTop rectangle height = 8 cm \u2192 shaded rectangle height = 14 - 8 = 6 cm\nTotal base = 13 cm\nTop rectangle width = 6 cm \u2192 shaded rectangle width = 13 - 6 = 7 cm\nArea = 6 cm \u00d7 7 cm = 42 cm\u00b2\n\nStudent's Likely Calculation:\nAssumed shaded rectangle height equals top rectangle height (8 cm)\nUsed total base (13 cm) directly as width\nArea = 8 cm \u00d7 7 cm = 56 cm\u00b2\n\nReasoning Flaw:\nThe student incorrectly used the top rectangle's height (8 cm) for the shaded rectangle's height instead of calculating the missing vertical dimension (14 - 8 = 6 cm). This stems from failing to recognize that composite shapes require subtracting overlapping dimensions to find component lengths. They correctly identified the shaded width (13 - 6 = 7 cm) but misapplied a given length from the wrong section for the height.\n\nDistinction from Related Errors:\nThis isn't a case of multiplying all given dimensions (they omitted total height 14 cm) or confusing area with perimeter. The error specifically involves misaligning vertical lengths between composite sections rather than general dimension confusion.",
