  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nTotal balls remain 7 after replacement. Probability = 3/7.\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\nUsed denominator 6 instead of 7: 3/6.\n\nSpecific Reasoning Flaw:\nThe student treated the second pick as dependent on the first despite replacement, incorrectly reducing the total to 6. This assumes the first yellow ball wasn't replaced, altering the total when it actually remains 7.\n\nMisconception Link:\nThe error stems from incorrectly applying dependent-event reasoning (adjusting the total) to an independent scenario (with replacement). The student misapplied dependency by reducing the denominator unnecessarily.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nUnlike errors involving numerator adjustments or misclassified criteria, this specifically misinterprets replacement as causing dependency, leading to an altered total rather than maintaining independence.",
