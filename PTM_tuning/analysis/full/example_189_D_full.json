  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( u_{15} = 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44 \\).\n\nStudent's likely calculation: \\( 1 - 3 \\times 15 \\) interpreted as \\( (1 - 3) \\times 15 = (-2) \\times 15 = -30 \\).\n\nThe error occurs because the student improperly altered the order of operations, subtracting \\( 3 \\) from \\( 1 \\) before multiplying by \\( 15 \\). This violates the requirement to compute \\( 3 \\times 15 \\) first due to multiplication preceding subtraction in standard arithmetic rules. The misconception directly links to misapplying operation precedence, where the student treated the subtraction and multiplication as left-associative instead of following correct operator hierarchy. This distinguishes it from unrelated errors like sign mishandling (e.g., \\(-3n\\) misapplied as \\(-3 + n\\)) or additive/multiplicative confusion. The flawed sequence of steps uniquely aligns with misordered operations rather than other listed misconceptions.",
