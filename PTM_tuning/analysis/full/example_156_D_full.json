  "explanation": "The correct simplification process:\n1. Keep the whole number: 6\n2. Simplify 3/18 by dividing numerator and denominator by GCD(3,18)=3: 3\u00f73=1, 18\u00f73=6\n3. Result: 6\u202f1/6\n\nThe student's flawed process:\n1. Viewed 6\u202f3/18 as a complete entity\n2. Failed to recognize the fractional part (3/18) requires separate simplification\n3. Did not attempt to reduce 3/18 despite common factors\n\nSpecific reasoning flaw:\nThe student treated the mixed number as irreducible without examining its fractional component. This stems from misunderstanding that simplification applies independently to the fraction portion of mixed numbers. The error shows they overlooked the need to reduce fractions within mixed numbers, not that they simplified the integer or denied mixed numbers' simplifiability entirely. Related misconceptions are ruled out as there's no evidence of improper whole number manipulation or complete rejection of mixed number simplification.",
