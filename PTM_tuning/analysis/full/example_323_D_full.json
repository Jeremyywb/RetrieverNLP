  "explanation": "The correct factorization requires two numbers multiplying to 36 (constant term) and summing to 15 (coefficient of x), which are 3 and 12. The student incorrectly chose 7 and 18, which multiply to 126 (not 36) and sum to 25 (not 15). \n\nThe error stems from reversing the required relationships: the student treated 15 as the product target and 36 as the sum target. This explains why they selected numbers with an irrelevant product/sum relationship (7\u00d718=126, 7+18=25) rather than enforcing 3\u00d712=36 and 3+12=15. \n\nThis specific reversal distinguishes the error from related misconceptions like focusing solely on the constant term's factors or arithmetic errors in valid pair selection. The flaw lies in misassigning the roles of multiplication and addition in the factoring criteria.",
