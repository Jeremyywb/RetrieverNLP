  "explanation": "To find the reciprocal of \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\), multiply by the inverse:  \n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{3} \\times -3 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Reciprocal} = -3\n\\]  \nThe student calculated:  \n\\[\n\\text{Reciprocal of } \\frac{1}{3} = 3 \\quad \\text{then wrote } \\frac{1}{3}  \n\\]  \nThe error occurred when the student treated \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), disregarding the negative sign entirely. This omission caused them to compute the reciprocal of the absolute value alone, yielding \\( 3 \\), but they incorrectly wrote \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) instead. The misconception aligns with ignoring the negative sign during reciprocal computation, not with misplacing it in the result. Related misconceptions like applying the negative post-reciprocal or declaring negatives undefined do not match, as the student preserved neither the sign nor the magnitude correctly.",
