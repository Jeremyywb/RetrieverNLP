  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes that line XY intersects two parallel lines, making it a transversal. The student incorrectly identified it as \"skew,\" which refers to non-parallel, non-intersecting lines in different planes. \n\nThe error occurred because the student conflated the geometric conditions for skew lines with those for transversals. While skew lines exist in separate planes and never intersect, XY clearly crosses the parallel lines in the same plane. The student likely focused on XY's diagonal orientation relative to the parallel lines but failed to recognize that coplanar intersecting lines cannot be skew. \n\nThis directly aligns with the primary misconception of focusing on visual position (e.g., diagonal crossing) while neglecting the requirement for skew lines to lack both intersection and coplanarity. It differs from related misconceptions about perpendicularity or parallelism, as the error specifically involves misapplying spatial reasoning rather than angle relationships.",
