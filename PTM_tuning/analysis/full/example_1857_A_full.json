  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Arrange numbers (2,2,4,7,10) and select the third value (4) as the median for an odd-numbered set.\n\nStudent's likely error: Calculated \\(\\frac{4+7}{2} = 5.5\\) (rounded to 5) by averaging the third and fourth numbers instead of selecting the middle value.\n\nSpecific flaw: Mistakenly applied the even-numbered dataset method (averaging two central values) to an odd-numbered set, treating positions 3 and 4 as \"middle\" rather than using position 3 alone.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly stems from treating the odd-numbered set as requiring an average of two values, not recognizing that the single middle term defines the median.\n\nDistinction from related errors: This differs from calculating the mean (25/5=5), as the student specifically referenced positional values (4 and 7) rather than summing all terms.\n\nCritical divergence: At the step where the median identification method for odd/even sets is misapplied, not a confusion between median and mean.",
