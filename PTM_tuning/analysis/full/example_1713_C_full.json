  "explanation": "The correct calculation for cell \\(\\bigstar\\) is \\(20 \\times 5 = 100\\). \nThe student computed \\(20 + 5 = 25\\) instead. \nThe error stems from treating the grid cell as requiring addition of the row and column headers rather than their product. \nThis reflects a fundamental confusion between additive and multiplicative relationships in grid multiplication, where each cell must represent partial products of the partitioned factors. \nThe error is distinct from writing digits side-by-side (which would yield \\(205\\) or \\(25\\) from \\(2\\) and \\(5\\)) or misapplying distribution (which would involve incorrect splitting of terms). \nThe direct substitution of addition for multiplication aligns exclusively with the core arithmetic operation confusion.",
