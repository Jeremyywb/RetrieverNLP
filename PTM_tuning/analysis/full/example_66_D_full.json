  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n```\n 4.72\n-3.10\n------\n 1.62\n```\nStudent's error:\n```\n 4.72\n+3.10\n------\n 7.82\n```\nThe student added instead of subtracting, treating the minus sign as addition. This directly contradicts the problem's operation while maintaining proper decimal alignment. The misconception \"subtracts instead of adds\" refers to misapplying operations in the opposite direction (e.g., subtracting in an addition problem), whereas here the student replaced subtraction with addition entirely. This differs from decimal alignment errors, which would still involve subtraction but with misplaced digits. The answer matches exact addition results, confirming the operation swap rather than alignment issues.",
