  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 0.8 \\times 0.15 = (8 \\times 15) \\times 10^{-3} = 120 \\times 0.001 = 0.12 \\).\n\nStudent's calculation: Likely computed \\( 8 \\times 15 = 120 \\), then misplaced the decimal by counting 2 places from the left (yielding \\( 1.20 \\)) instead of 3 places from the right.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student applied decimal placement by starting at the leftmost digit of the product (120) and moving rightward, rather than counting total decimal places from the right. This caused an extra magnitude increase inconsistent with multiplying values <1.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly matches counting decimal positions from the left, as 1.20 results from placing the decimal after the first digit (left-to-right), not accounting for all three required decimal places.\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"thinking decimals multiply to make bigger numbers,\" as the error stems from decimal placement mechanics, not a flawed expectation about magnitude direction. The correct product's magnitude (smaller than both factors) wasn't considered at all in the student's decimal placement.\n\nNon-applicable misconceptions: There's no evidence the student preserved digit positions incorrectly (e.g., misaligning place values during multiplication) or performed correct decimal shifts but misplaced the final decimal.",
