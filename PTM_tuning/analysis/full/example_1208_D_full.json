  "explanation": "The correct interpretation recognizes a positive slope in a distance-time graph indicates increasing distance from home, i.e., movement away. \n\nThe student incorrectly associated the positive slope with \"stopped walking,\" likely reasoning:  \n1. They observed a section of the graph (the horizontal line) where distance was constant and correctly identified it as stopping.  \n2. When asked about the positive slope, they conflated this with the horizontal section's meaning, failing to distinguish between zero slope (no movement) and non-zero slope (movement).  \n\nThe flaw stems from misapplying the \"constant distance = stopping\" rule to a sloping section. The student did not recognize that a non-zero gradient (positive or negative) inherently represents motion. This directly ties to the misconception of confusing constant distance with stopping, as they extended the \"stopping\" interpretation to a context where distance was actively changing.  \n\nThe error is distinct from gradient/rate confusion because the mistake lies in misclassifying motion as rest, not misjudging speed or direction.",
