  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The rocket's height at 40s minus height at 10s (e.g., 60m - 20m = 40m).  \nStudent's error: They likely used only the final height value of 60m at 40s as the answer.  \nFlaw: The student treated the final y-coordinate as the total distance traveled, ignoring the starting height at 10s.  \nMisconception link: This assumes the height at a single endpoint represents cumulative travel, confusing position with displacement.  \nDistinction: This differs from adding start/end points (which would yield 80m if values were 20m and 60m) or misreading data points.  \nFocus: The error stems from isolating the final value rather than computing the vertical change over the interval.",
