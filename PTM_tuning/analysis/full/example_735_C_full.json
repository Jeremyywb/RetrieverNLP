  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nShaded rectangle width = Total width - First step width = 23m - 7m = 16m  \nShaded rectangle height = Total height - Third step height = 22m - 8m = 14m  \nArea = 16m \u00d7 14m = 224m\u00b2\n\nStudent's likely error:\nWidth = Middle step width (23m - 7m - 6m = 10m)  \nHeight = First step height + Third step height = 5m + 8m = 13m  \nArea = 10m \u00d7 13m = 130m\u00b2\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student used the middle rectangle's standalone width (10m) instead of the shaded section's actual horizontal span (16m). They incorrectly summed unrelated vertical measurements (5m+8m) rather than calculating the true vertical span from the composite structure.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThis shows failure to derive dimensions through geometric relationships in composite shapes. The student treated step heights/widths as isolated values to combine, rather than analyzing spatial relationships to determine the shaded rectangle's boundaries.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis isn't a perimeter confusion (they multiplied) or full-length misuse (they did subtract some lengths), but specifically flawed decomposition of composite shapes to find required dimensions.",
