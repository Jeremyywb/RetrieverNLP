  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\)  \nStudent's calculation: \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\)  \n\nThe student multiplied only two dimensions instead of three, treating the cube as a 2D shape (square) rather than 3D. This reflects a failure to recognize that volume requires three independent measurements (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height), even when edges are equal. The error directly stems from applying area calculation logic (squaring) to a volumetric problem.  \n\nWhile \"mixes up cubing and squaring\" is related, the root issue is the omission of the third dimension, as evidenced by the absence of a third factor in their calculation. Other misconceptions like general volume confusion are less specific to this error pattern.",
