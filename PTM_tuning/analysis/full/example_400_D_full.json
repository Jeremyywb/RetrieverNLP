  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n58.2684 \u2192 Look at 2nd decimal (6). Since 6 \u22655, round 1st decimal up: 2\u21923. Result: 58.3\n\nStudent's error: \nChanged whole number (58\u219259) while keeping .2 in tenths place: 59.2\n\nSpecific flaw: \nThe student rounded the ones place (8) instead of the tenths place (2). They incorrectly used the 6 in the hundredths place to modify the whole number 58 to 59, rather than using it to adjust the tenths digit.\n\nMisconception link: \nThis shows a misapplication of place value hierarchy - treating the hundredths digit as justification to alter the ones column instead of the tenths column. The rounding operation was applied to the wrong positional column.\n\nDistinguishing from related errors: \nThis isn't significant figures confusion (which would affect leading digits) or decimal part addition (which would preserve the whole number). The error specifically demonstrates incorrect column selection for rounding.\n\nFinal confirmation: \nOnly the \"wrong place value\" misconception explains both the altered whole number and retained tenths digit in the incorrect answer.",
