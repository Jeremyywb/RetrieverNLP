  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{3}{11} \\div 3 = \\frac{3}{11} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3 \\times 1}{11 \\times 3} = \\frac{3}{33} = \\frac{1}{11}\\).\n\nStudent's error: \\(\\frac{3}{11} \\div 3 = \\frac{3 \\times 3}{11 \\times 3} = \\frac{9}{33}\\).\n\nThe student incorrectly multiplied both numerator and denominator by 3 instead of dividing. This stems from misapplying division as a uniform scaling operation: they treated division by 3 as equivalent to multiplying numerator/denominator by 3 to \"balance\" the operation. This directly matches the misconception that division by an integer requires multiplying both terms by the integer. \n\nThe error differs from related misconceptions about dividing terms (which would involve dividing numerator/denominator by 3) or multiplying fractions (which would require two fractions). The student specifically conflated division with multiplicative scaling of both fraction components.",
