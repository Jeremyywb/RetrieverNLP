  "explanation": "To solve \\( 0.3 \\div \\bigstar = 1.2 \\), the correct approach requires isolating \\(\\bigstar\\) through inverse operations: \\(\\bigstar = 0.3 \\div 1.2 = 0.25\\). \n\nThe student likely computed \\( 1.2 \\div 0.3 = 4 \\), reversing the dividend and divisor. This error stems from misidentifying the divisor (\\(\\bigstar\\)) as the quotient (1.2), treating the equation as \\(\\bigstar = 1.2 \\div 0.3\\) instead of \\(\\bigstar = 0.3 \\div 1.2\\). \n\nThe misconception directly caused the inversion of the division relationship. This differs from confusing division with multiplication (which would yield \\(0.3 \\times 1.2\\)) or misapplying commutativity (which would alter the equation structure). The error specifically reflects a misassignment of divisor/quotient roles, not operational inversion or commutativity assumptions.",
