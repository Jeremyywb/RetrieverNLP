  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n```\n  0.510\n- 0.202\n--------\n  0.308\n```\nStudent's likely steps:\n```\n  0.51\n-0.202\n--------\n  0.312\n```\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the missing thousandths digit in 0.51 as zero but failed to borrow when subtracting 2 from it. They subtracted 2 from 0 directly (writing 2 instead of borrowing), then preserved the 1 in the hundredths place. This occurred because they did not recognize that 0.51 must be rewritten as 0.510 to align place values properly before subtracting. The error stems from misaligning decimal places, causing incorrect digit-wise subtraction without borrowing. This aligns with \"lines up digits incorrectly\" rather than treating zeros as tens or place-value confusion about zeros themselves.\n\nDistinction: Unlike borrowing errors involving zeros-as-tens, this mistake specifically ignores place-value alignment requirements, causing digits to be subtracted from incorrect positions.",
