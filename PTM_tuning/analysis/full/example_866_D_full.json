  "explanation": "The correct calculation subtracts the car's level from the office level: \\( 7 - (-2) = 9 \\). \n\nThe student likely counted floors from 7 down to 0 (7 floors) but stopped there, neglecting the basement. This suggests they calculated \\( 7 - 0 = 7 \\), treating the endpoint as 0 instead of -2. \n\nThe error stems from failing to recognize that the distance between two points on a number line requires subtracting the final position from the initial position, even when negatives are involved. By ignoring the -2 and defaulting to 0, they truncated the problem. \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of not properly subtracting the endpoints (treating the basement level as 0 instead of -2), distinct from direction errors (which would involve adding instead of subtracting) or misapplying absolute values. \n\nThe student\u2019s answer matches the exact number of floors from 7 to 0, confirming they omitted the negative portion of the calculation.",
