  "explanation": "To simplify \\( \\frac{4t^2 + 1}{4t - 2} \\), one must factor both numerator and denominator. The denominator factors as \\( 2(2t - 1) \\), but the numerator \\( 4t^2 + 1 \\) is irreducible over real numbers (a sum of squares). Since no common factors exist, the expression cannot be simplified.\n\nThe student likely split the fraction term-by-term: \\( \\frac{4t^2}{4t} + \\frac{1}{-2} \\), incorrectly simplifying to \\( t + \\frac{1}{2} \\). This assumes terms in a polynomial can be independently canceled or divided across numerator and denominator, which is invalid without factoring. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying cancellation rules to individual terms rather than factoring to identify common factors. This aligns with canceling perceived (but nonexistent) factors in algebraic fractions. It differs from canceling identical terms (e.g., removing matching \\( t \\) terms) or misapplying the difference of squares, as the numerator's structure was fundamentally misunderstood.",
