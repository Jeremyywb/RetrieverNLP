  "explanation": "Correct first step:\n\\( \\frac{m}{4} -1 = 20 \\)\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\\( \\frac{m}{4} = 21 \\)\n\nStudent's reasoning likely concluded both steps were invalid. They may have incorrectly prioritized multiplying first to eliminate the denominator, dismissing Tom's valid addition. When analyzing Katie's step, they recognized that multiplying only the \\(\\frac{m}{4}\\) term by 4 (yielding \\(m-1=80\\)) ignores the \"-1\" term's need to also be multiplied by 4. However, they failed to see that Tom's addition properly isolated \\(\\frac{m}{4}\\) first. This reflects a misapplication of inverse operation order, where the student incorrectly assumes multiplication must precede addition/subtraction rather than addressing terms sequentially. The error aligns with confusing operation priority in equation solving, distinct from purely arithmetic errors or misapplying inverse operations to single terms.",
