  "explanation": "Correct alignment:\n```\n\u202f3152\n-\u202f809\n```\nStudent's alignment:\n```\n\u00a0\u00a03152\n-\u00a0\u00a089\n```\nThe student omitted the zero in the tens place of 809, writing it as 89. This reflects a misunderstanding of place value notation where zeros are necessary to maintain positional integrity. By removing the zero, they incorrectly reduced 809 to 89 (changing the hundreds place from 8 to 0), then aligned this truncated number with 3152. This error specifically stems from treating zeros as optional rather than required placeholders. Unlike misconceptions about subtraction commutativity or zero-as-ten rules, this error directly involves digit omission rather than operational properties or borrowing mechanics.",
