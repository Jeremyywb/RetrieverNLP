  "explanation": "The correct calculation adds corresponding components:\n\\( 2 + (-1) = 1 \\) (first component)\n\\( 3 + 0 = 3 \\) (second component)\n\nThe student's answer suggests they calculated:\n\\( 2 + (-1) = -2 \\) and \\( 3 + 0 = 0 \\)\n\nThe error stems from misapplying operations for signed numbers. In the first component, the student multiplied \\( 2 \\times (-1) = -2 \\) instead of adding, likely interpreting the \"+\" between vectors as requiring sign-based multiplication. This aligns with treating addition as a sign interaction rule rather than component-wise summation. For the second component, they extended this flawed logic by multiplying \\( 3 \\times 0 = 0 \\), ignoring the additive identity property of zero.\n\nThis differs from listed misconceptions like conflating horizontal/vertical directions or mishandling absolute values, as the error specifically replaces addition with erroneous multiplication of components, driven by misinterpreting how signs interact during vector operations.",
