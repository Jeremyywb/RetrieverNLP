  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes that y=3 and y=-2 are horizontal lines, which are linear functions with zero slope. The student incorrectly agreed that these are vertical lines (Katie's claim). \n\nThe error stems from confusing the orientation of constant functions. The equations y=3 and y=-2 represent horizontal lines because all points share the same y-value. Vertical lines require equations of the form x=constant, which never appeared in the problem. \n\nThe student likely associated \"y=\" notation with vertical direction, misapplying the relationship between equation structure and graph orientation. This directly connects to the misconception that vertical lines use \"y=\" equations. \n\nThis differs from thinking x=constant is horizontal (a related misconception), as the error here specifically inverts the equation types rather than misassigning direction to x= equations.",
