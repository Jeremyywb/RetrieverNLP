  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Order the data: -4, 3, 5, 6, 18, 18\n2. Identify middle values: 5 and 6\n3. Average them: (5 + 6)/2 = 5.5\n\nStudent's error:\n- Used original unsorted list: 3,5,6,18,18,-4\n- Selected the fourth number (18) as the median\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student treated the unsorted list's positional middle (fourth element) as the median. This assumes the data is pre-ordered and skips the critical sorting step required to ensure values are arranged for proper median identification. The misconception directly corresponds to failing to order data first, as opposed to confusing median with mode (which would require recognizing 18 as the most frequent value). The error is distinct from forgetting to average middle values in even datasets, as the student didn't reach the stage of handling two middle values.",
