  "explanation": "The correct calculation determines the gradient between (0,2) and (5,6):  \nChange in cost (\u0394y) = \u00a36 - \u00a32 = \u00a34  \nChange in distance (\u0394x) = 5 miles - 0 = 5 miles  \nCost per mile = \u0394y/\u0394x = \u00a34/5 = \u00a30.80.\n\nThe student likely calculated \u00a36/5 miles = \u00a31.20, using the final point's y-coordinate (6) and x-coordinate (5) directly. This assumes gradient equals y/x at a single point rather than the change in y over change in x between two points. \n\nThe error stems from interpreting gradient as a simple division of coordinates at an endpoint, ignoring the initial value at (0,2). This directly matches the misconception that gradient equals y/x at a point, not the rate of change. \n\nIt differs from \"sum of coordinates\" errors (e.g., (6+2)/(5+0)=1.60) or axis-switching (which would produce values like 5/6). The specific use of endpoint coordinates aligns uniquely with the y/x-at-a-point flaw.",
