  "explanation": "Correct estimation: \\( 505 \\div 198 \\approx 500 \\div 200 = 2.5 \\). Actual quotient is slightly higher (2.55) since numerator and denominator were both underestimated.\n\nStudent's calculation: Their answer (3.11) suggests they computed \\( 198 \\times 3 = 594 \\), then tried to divide this into 505. This implies they reversed the division direction, calculating \\( 594 \\div 190 \\) instead of \\( 505 \\div 198 \\).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated division as commutative by effectively solving \\( (198 \\times 3) \\div 190 \\) instead of the original problem. This shows confusion about dividend/divisor roles, not merely arithmetic errors.\n\nMisconception link: By assuming the quotient could be derived through rearranged multiplication (3\u00d7198\u2248594), they violated division's non-commutativity. This differs from simple rounding errors or decimal misplacement.\n\nDistinction: Unlike generic estimation errors, this specifically involves reversing the relationship between dividend and divisor through multiplicative reasoning, aligning with the commutative misconception rather than calculation mistakes.",
