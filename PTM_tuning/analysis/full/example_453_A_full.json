  "explanation": "The correct sequence increases by 2 squares each time: 3\u21925\u21927\u21929\u219211. The student's answer (9 squares) repeats the fourth term's count. \n\nThe error stems from failing to apply the consistent term-to-term rule (+2) beyond the initial terms. The student likely identified the +2 difference between the first two patterns but didn't verify this rule against subsequent terms, leading them to halt the progression prematurely. \n\nThis directly connects to the misconception of using only early terms to establish a rule without ensuring its linear consistency. Unlike related misconceptions (e.g., misidentifying the starting term), the flaw here is specifically the assumption that the pattern might not require continued application of the +2 rule, despite clear evidence across all four given terms.",
