  "explanation": "To convert 16/25 to a percentage: (16 \u00f7 25) \u00d7 100 = 0.64 \u00d7 100 = 64%.  \nThe student likely treated the numerator \"16\" as the percentage value directly, writing 16% without performing division or scaling.  \n\nThe error stems from conflating the fraction's numerator with the percentage value, ignoring the need to calculate how many parts exist per 100. This misconception assumes percentages match numerators when denominators are arbitrary, rather than requiring proportional adjustment.  \n\nThis differs from related errors like multiplying denominators by 10 (which would produce 16/250 = 6.4%) or misunderstanding percentages as only applying to denominators of 100. The student's direct substitution of the numerator shows a failure to recognize percentages inherently represent ratios scaled to 100.",
