  "explanation": "To solve \\(0.4x - 3 = -1\\) graphically, one would locate where the line \\(y = 0.4x - 3\\) intersects \\(y = -1\\). The correct intersection occurs at \\(x=5\\), verified by substitution: \\(0.4(5) - 3 = -1\\). \n\nThe student likely set \\(y=0\\) instead of \\(y=-1\\), solving \\(0.4x - 3 = 0\\) to get \\(x=7.5\\). This error stems from conflating solutions to the equation with the x-intercept (where \\(y=0\\)), despite the problem explicitly specifying \\(y=-1\\). \n\nThe mistake is distinct from confusing the y-intercept (which is fixed at \\(-3\\)) or misapplying algebraic steps, as the error is purely graphical interpretation. The student's focus on the x-intercept directly aligns with the misconception of associating solutions with roots rather than the given \\(y\\)-value.",
