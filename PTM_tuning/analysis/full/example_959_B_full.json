  "explanation": "The horizontal section in a distance-time graph indicates zero speed (correct calculation: slope = \u0394distance/\u0394time = 0). The student incorrectly associated the horizontal segment with movement (incorrect conclusion: \"walking away\"). \n\nThe error stems from treating the graph as a velocity-time graph, where a horizontal line represents constant velocity. In distance-time graphs, horizontal segments instead indicate no displacement change, i.e., stopped motion. \n\nThis confusion directly aligns with the misconception of conflating displacement-time and velocity-time graph interpretations. The student misapplied the meaning of horizontal lines across graph types, leading them to infer continuous motion. \n\nThis differs from related misconceptions (e.g., misinterpreting gradient steepness) because the error specifically involves graph-type confusion rather than gradient-speed relationships or motion continuity assumptions.",
