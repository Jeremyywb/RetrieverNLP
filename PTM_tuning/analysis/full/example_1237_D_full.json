  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires dividing the diameter by 2:  \n\\( r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{5.4}{2} = 2.7 \\, \\mathrm{cm} \\).  \n\nThe student's answer equals the original diameter (\\( 5.4 \\, \\mathrm{cm} \\)), indicating no division occurred.  \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the radius-diameter relationship: Instead of halving the diameter, the student retained its value as if radius and diameter were equivalent.  \n\nThis matches the misconception of treating radius and diameter as interchangeable quantities, not merely doubling (which would produce \\( 10.8 \\, \\mathrm{cm} \\)) or confusing division operations.  \n\nThe error is distinct from confusing chord/radius or division commutativity, as no extraneous geometric elements or inverted division (\\( 2 \\div 5.4 \\)) are involved.",
