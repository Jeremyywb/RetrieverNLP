  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \\), then \\( 0.6 \\times 100 = 60\\% \\).\n\nStudent's likely steps: Treated \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) as \"3.5\" by placing a decimal between numerator and denominator, then interpreted this as 35%.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student converted the fraction directly to a decimal by inserting a decimal point between the numerator and denominator (3.5) instead of performing division. This decimal misinterpretation led to treating 3.5 as equivalent to 35% without scaling to hundredths.\n\nConnection to misconception: This matches the error of placing a decimal between numerator and denominator to create a percentage, as 3.5 was misread as 35% rather than requiring multiplication by 100.\n\nDistinction: Unlike simply appending % to the denominator (which would yield 5%) or multiplying numerator/denominator (15%), this error specifically stems from decimal misplacement in the fraction-to-decimal conversion step.",
