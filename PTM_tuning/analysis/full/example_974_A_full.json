  "explanation": "The correct reflection requires each vertex to be mirrored across the diagonal line, preserving equal perpendicular distances. For a point at coordinates (a,b), its reflection over line y=x would be (b,a). The student likely applied a vertical or horizontal reflection (e.g., reflecting (a,b) to (-a,b) or (a,-b) instead of (b,a)), treating the grid's edge as the mirror line rather than the diagonal. This stems from misidentifying the axis of symmetry as orthogonal (horizontal/vertical) when the problem explicitly used a diagonal mirror line. The error matches reflecting across an incorrect axis rather than partial reflections or distance miscalculations, as the shape was mirrored coherently but in the wrong direction. Related misconceptions like distance equivalence or partial symmetry aren't primary here, as the reflection directionality itself was flawed.",
