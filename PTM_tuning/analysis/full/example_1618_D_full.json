  "explanation": "The correct identification requires recognizing that the shape has a square base with triangular faces converging at an apex, forming a square-based pyramid. The student incorrectly identified the triangular faces as the defining feature of the base. \n\nThe error stems from misattributing the lateral face shape (triangles) as the base shape, rather than recognizing the singular square face as the foundational polygon. This caused them to invert the naming convention, where 3D pyramids are classified by their base polygon. \n\nThe misconception directly manifests in prioritizing the visible triangular faces over the square base when naming the shape. This differs from confusing prisms with pyramids (which involves misunderstanding face relationships) or diagram misinterpretation (which would involve spatial reasoning failures). The error specifically reflects a misunderstanding of naming conventions tied to base identification.",
