  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Count each section as a distinct outcome, yielding 6 total outcomes (since the spinner has 6 equal sections).\n\nStudent's error: Listed labels \"1,3\" or \"5\" (likely meaning 1, 3, and 5) as outcomes instead of counting sections.\n\nKey flaw: The student treated distinct numerical labels as the only possible outcomes, ignoring that duplicate labels on separate sections create unique physical outcomes. This conflates \"possible numerical results\" (3 unique numbers) with \"physical landing possibilities\" (6 sections).\n\nMisconception link: The error directly stems from equating outcomes with unique label values rather than distinct spinner sections. Each section is an independent outcome regardless of label repetition.\n\nDistinction: This isn't merely miscounting sections (which would relate to incorrect total possibilities) but fundamentally misdefining what constitutes an outcome in probability. The student correctly identified all label values but failed to recognize sections as atomic outcomes.\n\nFinal verification: The error matches the primary misconception listed (\"confuses all possible outcomes with options available\") better than the related \"uses outcome as numerator in probability,\" which would involve fractional calculations.",
