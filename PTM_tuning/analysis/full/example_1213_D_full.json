  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n\\( \\frac{2}{5} \\div 3 = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{15} \\)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:  \n\\( \\frac{2}{5} \\div 3 = \\frac{2 \\times 3}{5 \\times 3} = \\frac{6}{15} \\)\n\nThe student multiplied both numerator and denominator by 3 instead of only multiplying the denominator. This stems from misapplying fraction equivalence principles to division. They treated division as requiring proportional scaling of both terms, preserving the fraction's value rather than dividing it. \n\nThis differs from \"multiplies the numerator by the integer\" (which would yield \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\)) and \"divides the denominator\" (which would produce \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\)). The error specifically reflects a conflation of division with equivalent fraction generation, where the student incorrectly assumed both terms must scale equally to maintain mathematical \"balance,\" nullifying the division's effect entirely.",
