  "explanation": "The correct area calculation uses only base (40 cm) and perpendicular height (15 cm):  \n\\( \\frac{40 \\times 15}{2} \\).  \n\nThe student multiplied all three values:  \n\\( \\frac{40 \\times 25 \\times 15}{2} \\).  \n\nThe error stems from treating the slant height (25 cm) as necessary for area computation, despite it being irrelevant to the formula. The student assumed all provided dimensions must be included, adding an extra multiplication by 25. This directly aligns with the misconception of believing all given numerical values must be used, even when they are not mathematically required.  \n\nThis differs from simply multiplying all visible numbers (which might ignore formula structure) or not knowing the formula entirely (the student correctly included division by 2). The error specifically reflects an unnecessary inclusion of the slant height rather than a disregard for the formula\u2019s components.",
