  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( (+5) \\times (-3) = -15 \\)\n\nStudent's calculation: \\( 5 \\times 3 = +15 \\)\n\nThe student multiplied the absolute values 5 and 3 correctly but failed to apply the negative sign from the second term. This indicates they treated both terms as positive numbers during multiplication, disregarding the interaction between positive and negative signs. The error stems from neglecting to recognize that multiplying numbers with opposite signs produces a negative result. This specifically aligns with a misunderstanding of sign rules in multiplication, not with confusion about multiple negatives or additive operations (e.g., there's no indication they thought \"-3\" was positive due to subtraction in the binomial). Their calculation preserves the numerical product but omits the required sign convention.",
