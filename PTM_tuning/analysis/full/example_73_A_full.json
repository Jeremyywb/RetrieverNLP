  "explanation": "To round 326 to the nearest 1000:\n- The hundreds digit (3) determines rounding; since 3 < 5, round down to 0.\n\nThe student incorrectly rounded up to 1000. Their reasoning likely skipped evaluating the hundreds place entirely, treating 326 as if it were already above the midpoint (500) for rounding up to the next 1000. This indicates they did not recognize that the hundreds digit is the critical place value for this operation. \n\nThe error stems from misunderstanding which digit governs rounding to 1000, not from a belief that rounding must always change the number (since 0 is a valid rounded result) or from misjudging proximity at a different place value (e.g., tens or units). The flaw is specifically about selecting the wrong reference digit, not about over/under-rounding based on correct place value analysis.",
