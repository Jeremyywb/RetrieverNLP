  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 321 \u00f7 7 = 45.857\u2026, requiring rounding up to 46 because partial adults aren't possible.\n\nStudent's calculation: 321 \u00f7 7 = 45 with remainder 6, then stopped at the whole number 45.\n\nThe error occurred when the student treated the division remainder as sufficient justification to truncate the result, rather than recognizing that any remainder (even \"r6\") necessitates rounding up in this context. The misconception manifests in failing to apply ceiling rounding after integer division in a real-world scenario where fractional results are invalid. \n\nThis differs from confusing quotient/remainder roles (they correctly identified 45 as the quotient) or arithmetic errors (their division was accurate). The core flaw is interpreting \"r6\" as a standalone value rather than an indicator that 45 full groups of 7 leave 6 children requiring an additional adult.",
