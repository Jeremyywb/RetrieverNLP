  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\text{Depth at 4min} - \\text{Depth at 2min} = 9 \\, \\text{cm} - 3 \\, \\text{cm} = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\nStudent's error: Reported \\( 9 \\, \\text{cm} \\), matching the depth at the fourth minute alone.\n\nReasoning flaw: The student identified the value at the fourth minute but omitted subtracting the second-minute value. This directly stems from misinterpreting \"difference\" as a single endpoint value rather than a subtraction of two points. \n\nThe misconception caused the student to treat the final value as the answer instead of computing the vertical change between the two times. This distinguishes it from related errors like using incorrect data points, as the student correctly identified the fourth-minute value but failed to perform the required subtraction.",
