  "explanation": "The correct probability is calculated as \\( 1 - \\frac{\\binom{4}{2}}{\\binom{9}{2}} = 1 - \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{30}{36} = \\frac{60}{72} \\). \n\nThe student likely computed only the probability of exactly one red ball: \\( \\frac{5}{9} \\times \\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{4}{9} \\times \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{40}{72} \\), then stopped. \n\nThe flaw lies in omitting the two-red-ball case \\( \\frac{\\binom{5}{2}}{\\binom{9}{2}} = \\frac{20}{72} \\). This shows the student failed to account for all favorable outcomes (both one-red and two-red scenarios), directly causing the undercount. \n\nThis aligns with \"fails to consider all possible outcomes\" rather than arithmetic errors like adding numerators or misapplying operations. The error is distinct from, say, adding probabilities instead of multiplying, as the student correctly multiplied for individual cases but missed an entire case entirely.",
