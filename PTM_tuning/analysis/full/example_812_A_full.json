  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The graph shows displacement vs. time with constant velocity. Speed = displacement/time \u2192 6 m/s = \u2605/10s \u2192 \u2605 = 60m.\n\nStudent's error: Likely calculated 6 m/s \u00d7 (10s/2) = 30m. \n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the straight-line displacement graph as requiring triangular area calculation (base\u00d7height/2) instead of direct proportionality. This corresponds to misapplying acceleration formulas to constant velocity motion. \n\nConnection to misconception: They multiplied speed by half the time interval (10/2=5) rather than full time, assuming velocity wasn't constant despite explicit problem statement. \n\nDistinction from related errors: Not scale misreading (graph endpoints are clear) nor axis scaling misconception (origin-to-first-value alignment isn't required here).",
