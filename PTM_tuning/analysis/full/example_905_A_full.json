  "explanation": "The correct classification requires recognizing angles between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 as obtuse. The student labeled an angle in this range as acute (0\u00b0-90\u00b0). Their error stems from misjudging the angle's measure as being below 90\u00b0, likely due to visual estimation without applying the 90\u00b0 threshold rule. This directly aligns with the misconception that acute angles include all visibly \"sharp\" angles regardless of actual degree measurement. The error isn't caused by confusion about 180\u00b0 angles or arm lengths, as those factors don't apply to this specific angle's classification. The core flaw is the failure to use the 90\u00b0 benchmark to separate acute and obtuse angles.",
