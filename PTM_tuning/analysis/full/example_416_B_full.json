  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nTom: 3 circles \u00f7 3 = 1 circle, 6 squares \u00f7 3 = 2 squares \u21d2 1:2 ratio  \nKatie: 5 circles \u00f7 5 = 1 circle, 10 squares \u00f7 5 = 2 squares \u21d2 1:2 ratio  \n\nStudent's Error:\nStudent likely saw Katie's 5:10 as valid 1:2 but rejected Tom's 3:6.  \n\nReasoning Flaw:\nThe student failed to recognize that ratios can be scaled proportionally. They treated 3:6 as distinct from 1:2 rather than its scaled equivalent.  \n\nMisconception Link:\nThis error directly stems from not understanding that multiplying both terms of a ratio preserves the relationship. The student accepted Katie's 5:10 because it visibly aligns with \"5 pairs\" of 1:2 but dismissed Tom's smaller scale.  \n\nDistinction from Related Errors:\nThis is not about grouping or total parts but specifically about scaling. The student recognized proportionality in one case but not the other due to fixation on absolute quantities rather than relative relationships.",
