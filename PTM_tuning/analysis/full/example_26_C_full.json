  "explanation": "Correct calculation: For point (4,0), radius \\( r = \\sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = 4 \\). Squaring gives \\( r^2 = 16 \\).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely calculated \\( 4^2 + 0^2 = 16 \\), then divided by 2 to get 8, writing \\( x^2 + y^2 = 8 \\).\n\nFlaw explanation: The student incorrectly halved the sum of squared coordinates instead of squaring the actual radius. This treats coordinates as independent terms to manipulate rather than components of a distance calculation.\n\nMisconception link: This reflects confusion between algebraic manipulation of coordinates and geometric distance computation. The student applied arithmetic operations to coordinate values directly rather than using the distance formula.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike adding coordinates for distance (which would yield 4 instead of 16), this error specifically alters the correct squared radius through unwarranted division, matching \"mixes up squaring and halving\" rather than distance formula errors.\n\nFinal confirmation: The error pattern matches exactly when testing (4,0): correct \\( 4^2 = 16 \\) vs. student's \\( (4^2 + 0^2)/2 = 8 \\).",
