  "explanation": "Correct approach:\n1. Substitute \\( y = 2x \\) into both inequalities.\n2. For Jo: \\( 2x + 1 > 2x \\) simplifies to \\( 1 > 0 \\), always true.\n3. For Paul: Substitute \\( y = 2x \\) into \\( -2x < y \\), getting \\( -2x < 2x \\). Solving:\n   - Add \\( 2x \\): \\( 0 < 4x \\) \u2192 \\( x > 0 \\).\n   - This only holds when \\( x > 0 \\), not for all \\( x \\).\n\nStudent's error:\n1. After substituting \\( y = 2x \\) into \\( -2x < y \\), they likely treated \\( -2x < 2x \\) as universally true.\n2. When solving \\( -2x < 2x \\), dividing by \\( x \\) without considering its sign:\n   - If \\( x > 0 \\): \\( -2 < 2 \\) (valid).\n   - If \\( x < 0 \\): Dividing by negative \\( x \\) requires flipping inequality: \\( -2 > 2 \\) (false).\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student failed to reverse the inequality when implicitly dividing by \\( x \\) (a variable that could be negative) during their analysis of Paul's claim. This directly corresponds to the misconception about maintaining inequality direction when multiplying/dividing by negatives.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis is not about reversing inequalities for no reason (first listed misconception) or symbol confusion (last one), but specifically about mishandling negative coefficients in inequalities. The error occurred during algebraic manipulation of the inequality itself, not from insufficient testing of cases.",
