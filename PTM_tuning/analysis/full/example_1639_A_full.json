  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \u00a355750 - \u00a325250 = \u00a330500 (subtracting charity amount from total winnings)\n\nStudent's calculation: \u00a355750 + \u00a325250 = \u00a381000 (adding both numbers)\n\nThe student incorrectly treated the charity donation as an amount to combine with the winnings rather than deduct. This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of whether the context requires aggregation (addition) or reduction (subtraction). The error stems from selecting the inverse operation of what the problem's action (\"gives to charity\") demands.\n\nThis directly corresponds to misinterpreting the directional relationship between quantities in a real-world context, rather than digit alignment (both numbers have 5 digits) or arithmetic execution errors. The error is distinct from subtracting when adding is needed - here, addition was erroneously used where subtraction was required.",
