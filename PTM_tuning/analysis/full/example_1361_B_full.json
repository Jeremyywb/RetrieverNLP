  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows \\(81 - 53 = 28\\) and \\(53 - 81 = -28\\), demonstrating subtraction's non-commutativity. The student incorrectly claims Miran is wrong \"because subtraction is commutative,\" reversing the actual reason. Their reasoning flaw stems from conflating the commutative property with its negation: they likely assumed \"commutative\" inherently meant \"order matters,\" without grasping that commutativity specifically means order doesn't affect the result. This directly connects to misapplying the term \"commutative\" to describe subtraction's actual behavior, rather than recognizing it as the property's absence. The error differs from related misconceptions about negative numbers or addition's commutativity, as it specifically mislabels the mathematical property itself.",
