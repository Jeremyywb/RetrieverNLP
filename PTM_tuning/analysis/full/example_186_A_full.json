  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \"Fifty-six thousand\" = 56,000 (5 in ten-thousands place, 6 in thousands place), \"thirteen\" = 13. Combined: 56,000 + 13 = 56013.\n\nStudent's error: Wrote 5613. This implies they interpreted \"fifty-six thousand\" as 5,600 (5 in thousands place, 6 in hundreds place), then added 13.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student failed to assign \"fifty-six\" to the ten-thousands and thousands place columns. They compressed both digits into lower place values (thousands and hundreds), reducing the magnitude by a factor of 10.\n\nMisconception link: This directly stems from misaligning numerical phrases with their corresponding place value columns. \"Fifty-six thousand\" requires separate placement of 5 (ten-thousands) and 6 (thousands), but the student treated them as sequential digits in lower positions.\n\nDistinction: Unlike zero-related errors, this involves incorrect digit placement rather than omission. The student recognized all components but mislocated them in the number structure.",
