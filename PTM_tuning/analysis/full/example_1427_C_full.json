  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nOriginal equation: x + 7 = [value]\nOperation: Subtract 7 from both sides\nResult: x = [value] - 7\n\nStudent's incorrect approach:\nOriginal equation: x + 7 = [value]\nOperation: Divide both sides by 7\nResult: x = ([value]/7) - 1 (if consistent) or invalid transformation\n\nSpecific reasoning flaw:\nThe student treated the additive term (+7) as a multiplicative factor. They attempted to reverse addition using division rather than recognizing that subtraction is required to isolate x. This stems from conflating inverse operations for different arithmetic relationships - applying multiplicative inverses (division) to an additive problem.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThe error demonstrates a fundamental confusion between reversing addition (which requires subtraction) and scaling operations (which require division). The student incorrectly associated the constant term in an additive expression with a scaling factor needing division, rather than a quantity needing subtraction.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis differs from confusing addition/subtraction inverses (correctly identifying the operation type but wrong direction) or misapplying multiplication (which would require an additive term to be multiplied). The unique mismatch of using division specifically reveals an incorrect pairing of operation types.",
