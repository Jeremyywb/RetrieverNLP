  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Total distance = area of two triangles. Each triangle has base=2 seconds and height=v. Area per triangle = (2\u00d7v)/2 = v mph\u00b7s. Total area = 2v mph\u00b7s. Convert seconds to hours: 2v\u00d7(1/3600) = 50 \u2192 v = (50\u00d73600)/2 = 90,000 mph. However, since the correct answer assumes time is in hours (despite label), correct answer is 25 mph.\n\nStudent's error: Student likely calculated 50 miles \u00f7 4 seconds = 12.5 mph, treating seconds as hours without conversion. \n\nSpecific flaw: The student assumed the numerical value of time (4 seconds) could directly divide distance without unit conversion, implying they treated axis scales as interchangeable. This aligns with believing graph scales must match, causing them to ignore unit dimensionality. \n\nDistinction: This differs from related misconceptions like misreading data points or origin assumptions, as the error stems directly from mismatched unit handling rather than graph interpretation.",
