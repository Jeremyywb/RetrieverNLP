  "explanation": "The correct operation uses \\( x^{\\square} \\) which allows entering any exponent. The student selected \\( x^{-1} \\), which computes reciprocals (equivalent to \\( x^{-1} \\)). \n\nThe error stems from conflating the general exponentiation operator (variable exponent) with the fixed reciprocal operation. The student likely interpreted \"raise to a power\" as requiring a negative exponent button, mistaking the fixed \\(-1\\) power as the universal exponent entry. \n\nThis aligns with misunderstanding \"to the power of\" as requiring a pre-set exponent value rather than recognizing the need for a button accepting arbitrary exponents. It specifically differs from fraction/decimal misconceptions, as \\( x^{-1} \\) isn't a conversion tool but a distinct inverse operation.",
