  "explanation": "The correct calculation multiplies weeks by days/week and hours/day: \\( 10 \\times 7 \\times 24 \\).\n\nThe student used \\( 10 \\times 5 \\times 24 \\), substituting 5 for 7 in the days/week conversion. This indicates they mistakenly believed there are 5 days in a week instead of 7. \n\nThe error stems from using an incorrect days-per-week ratio (5 instead of 7) when converting weeks to days, a direct misapplication of the conversion factor. This aligns with confusing standard time units (a week is 7 days, not 5) rather than miscalculating multi-step conversions or using fractional days like 7.5. \n\nThe mistake is specifically about substituting an erroneous days/week value, distinct from forgetting to convert weeks to days first or confusing hours with smaller units like minutes.",
