  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (-8) + 3 = -5  \nStudent's incorrect calculation: (-8) + 3 = -(8 + 3) = -11  \n\nThe student treated the addition operation as requiring absolute value summation followed by sign inheritance from the first term. This shows a failure to recognize that adding a positive number to a negative number reduces its magnitude. The error stems from disregarding directional movement on the number line (where +3 shifts toward zero from -8) and instead combining magnitudes indiscriminately.  \n\nThis aligns with adding without considering the operation's direction, as the student ignored the opposing signs and summed absolute values. It differs from sign-swapping errors (which would require misapplying subtraction rules) or pure subtraction mistakes (which would involve reversing the operation entirely).",
