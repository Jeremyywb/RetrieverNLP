  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{13}{40} = 0.325 \\), multiplied by 100 gives \\( 32.5\\% \\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\( 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\), then appended \"%\".\n\nThe student incorrectly doubled the numerator instead of performing division to convert to decimal form. This suggests they confused fraction-to-percentage conversion with a simplistic \"multiply numerator by 2\" shortcut, ignoring the denominator's role in scaling. The error stems from misapplying a hypothetical proportionality (like converting fractions with denominator 50 where doubling works) to all denominators. This aligns with the \"double the numerator\" misconception rather than others: there's no subtraction (which would yield \\( \\frac{40-13}{100} = 27\\% \\)) or multiplication of numerator/denominator (\\( 13 \\times 40 = 520\\% \\)), confirming the specific misapplication of scaling factors.",
