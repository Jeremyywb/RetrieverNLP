  "explanation": "Correct calculation compares absolute values:\n|-2.01| = 2.01 and |-2.1| = 2.1  \nSince 2.01 < 2.1, -2.01 is closer to zero.\n\nThe student likely compared -2.1 and -2.01 by treating the decimal portions as positive values:  \n0.1 (from -2.1) vs. 0.01 (from -2.01), incorrectly reasoning 0.1 < 0.01 due to fewer decimal places.\n\nThe flaw stems from misapplying positive decimal ordering to negative numbers. The student treated the decimals as standalone positive quantities rather than extensions of negative integers. This aligns with the misconception that negative decimals behave like positive decimals between integers, causing them to invert the true magnitude relationship.\n\nThis differs from tenths/hundredths confusion (which would involve misreading 0.1 as 0.10) or left-right digit comparison errors (which would manifest in comparing \"-2.1\" vs \"-2.01\" as strings rather than values).",
