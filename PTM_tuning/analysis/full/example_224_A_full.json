  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\sqrt{64 \\, \\mathrm{mm}^2} = 8 \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\).\n\nStudent's error: Calculated \\( 64 \\div 4 = 16 \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly associated reversing the squaring operation with division by 4 instead of applying the square root. This stems from conflating the inverse relationship between squaring and square rooting with additive partitioning (dividing into 4 equal parts). \n\nA key distinction: Errors like confusing perimeter (which involves multiplying by 4) would require misinterpreting the problem as a perimeter calculation, but here the arithmetic explicitly shows division by 4 rather than misapplying a perimeter formula. Similarly, doubling the square root (e.g., \\( 8 \\times 2 \\)) would require first correctly finding 8, which the student did not do. The direct division by 4 aligns with misapplying partitioning logic to reverse exponentiation.",
