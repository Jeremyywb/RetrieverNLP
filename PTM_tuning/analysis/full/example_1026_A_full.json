  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nLet bottom row be [\u2605, y, 2g]. Middle row: [\u2605 + y = 4f+6g] and [y + 2g]. Top row: (4f+6g) + (y + 2g). Since y can vary, multiple solutions exist:\n1. If \u2605=f: Then y=4f+6g - f=3f+6g \u2192 Middle right becomes 3f+8g \u2192 Top=7f+14g\n2. If \u2605=g: Then y=4f+6g - g=4f+5g \u2192 Middle right becomes 4f+7g \u2192 Top=8f+13g\n\nStudent's error:\nAssuming only \u2605=f works, likely by misapplying coefficients. They may have incorrectly equated \u2605 directly to 4f (thinking \"4f must come from \u2605 alone\") rather than recognizing \u2605 and y can combine coefficients. This fixation on isolated terms caused them to ignore the system's flexibility.\n\nDistinction:\nThis isn't about failing to collect like terms or partial operations, but rather rigidly associating coefficients in the middle row with single variables below, without recognizing algebraic combinations. The student stopped at one valid solution (Jo's) without testing Paul's due to this rigidity.",
