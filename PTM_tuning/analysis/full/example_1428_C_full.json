  "explanation": "The correct equation uses factors (x-1) and (x-3) derived from the x-intercepts at 1 and 3. The student's answer (x+1)(x-3) incorrectly substitutes +1 instead of -1 in the first factor. \n\nThe error occurs because the student likely interpreted the x-intercept x=1 as requiring (x+1) rather than (x-1), reversing the sign of the root when forming the factor. This directly corresponds to misapplying the relationship between roots and factors: the factor should equal zero at the root, requiring subtraction (x - root), not addition.\n\nThe misconception is distinct from general confusion about quadratic symmetry or absolute values, as the error specifically involves sign reversal in one factor. The incorrect y-intercept (-3 vs. 3) confirms the error stems from factor construction, not a failure to scale the equation.",
