  "explanation": "The correct completion of the square proceeds as:  \n\\(x^2 + 8x + 2 = (x^2 + 8x + 16) - 16 + 2 = (x+4)^2 -14\\).  \n\nThe student likely expanded \\((x+4)^2\\) to \\(x^2 +8x +16\\), then incorrectly retained the original constant term 2 without adjusting for the added 16.  \n\nThe flaw lies in treating the completed square \\((x+4)^2\\) as equivalent to \\(x^2 +8x +2\\), ignoring the need to balance the newly introduced 16. This caused them to incorrectly set \\(b = 2\\) instead of computing \\(2 - 16 = -14\\).  \n\nThis matches the misconception of retaining the original constant unmodified after forming the square, rather than compensating for the added square term. It differs from the misconception \"\\(b = -a^2\\)\" because the student preserved the original constant instead of automatically setting \\(b = -16\\).",
