  "explanation": "The correct calculation converts 4% to a fraction by dividing by 100: \\( \\frac{4}{100} = \\frac{1}{25} \\) after simplification. \n\nThe student likely wrote \\( \\frac{4}{10} \\) (reducing to \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\)) by incorrectly using the percentage value as the numerator and 10 as the denominator instead of 100. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the rule for two-digit percentages (e.g., 25% \u2192 \\( \\frac{25}{100} \\)) to single-digit percentages by treating the single digit as a numerator over 10. This bypassed the essential step of using 100 as the denominator, which is required for all percentages. \n\nThe mistake aligns with the misconception of directly mapping the percentage number to a denominator of 10 for single-digit cases, rather than recognizing percentages inherently represent \"per hundred.\" \n\nThis differs from the related misconception of dividing by 10 instead of 100 for decimal conversion, as the student produced a fraction with an incorrect denominator rather than an incorrect decimal.",
