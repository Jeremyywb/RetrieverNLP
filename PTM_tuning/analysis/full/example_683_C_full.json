  "explanation": "The correct identification of a cube number requires verifying that a number equals \\( n^3 \\) where \\( n \\) is an integer. For example, \\( 3^3 = 27 \\), but \\( 9 = 3^2 \\), not \\( 3^3 \\). \n\nThe student likely reasoned: \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\), interpreting \"cube\" as a single multiplication by 3 instead of three repeated multiplications. This conflates cubing (\\( n^3 \\)) with multiplying by 3 (\\( 3n \\)) or squaring (\\( n^2 \\)). \n\nThe error arises from misapplying the definition of cubing as a single multiplication by 3 rather than \\( n \\times n \\times n \\). This directly aligns with the misconception that cubing means multiplying by 3. \n\nDistinct from confusing cube numbers with multiples of 3 (e.g., selecting 6 or 12), the student\u2019s focus on 9 shows they associated \"3\" with the operation itself, not the result\u2019s divisibility. Their reasoning conflated the operator (\u00b3) with a scalar multiplier (\u00d73), leading to the incorrect answer.",
