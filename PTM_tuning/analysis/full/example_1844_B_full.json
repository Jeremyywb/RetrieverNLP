  "explanation": "To find the y-intercept of \\( y=(x-8)(x-6) \\), substitute \\( x=0 \\):  \n\\( y=(0-8)(0-6)=(-8)(-6)=48 \\), giving \\( (0,48) \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly used \\( 8 \\) and \\( 6 \\) as y-values when \\( x=0 \\), likely reasoning:  \n1. Observed the factored form \\( (x-8)(x-6) \\).  \n2. Associated the constants \\( 8 \\) and \\( 6 \\) with y-axis values instead of x-intercepts.  \n\nThe error stems from treating the roots \\( x=8 \\) and \\( x=6 \\) as y-intercept coordinates rather than substituting \\( x=0 \\). This conflates the roles of constants in factored form (which define x-intercepts) with y-intercept calculation.  \n\nThis matches the primary misconception: misapplying quadratic roots as y-intercepts. It differs from \"not knowing x=0 for y-intercept,\" as the student used \\( (0,y) \\) structure, but assigned incorrect y-values.",
