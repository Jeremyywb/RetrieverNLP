  "explanation": "The correct calculation follows the function machine sequence: subtract 2 from the input (7-2), then multiply by 5, yielding 5(7-2). \n\nThe student computed 7(5-2), which incorrectly applies subtraction to the multiplier (5-2) instead of the input. This shows they misapplied the order of operations by altering which term undergoes subtraction. \n\nThe error stems from treating the multiplier (5) as the subject of subtraction rather than the input (7), violating the function's defined sequence. This directly corresponds to modifying the operation's target instead of preserving its application to the input. \n\nIt differs from bracket-related misconceptions because the student correctly grouped terms but misplaced the operation. They also didn't invert operations (e.g., adding instead of subtracting), ruling out inverse-operation errors. The core flaw was misassigning where the given subtraction occurs.",
