  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 27\\, \\text{cm} \\div 100 = 0.27\\, \\text{m} \\).  \nStudent's incorrect step: After calculating \\( 27 \\div 100 = 0.27 \\), they rounded \\( 0.27 \\) to \\( 0.3 \\) (one decimal place).  \n\nThe error stems from treating the conversion as requiring rounding to the nearest tenth, despite the problem asking for an exact decimal equivalent. The student misapplied rounding rules to a context where precise unit conversion was needed. This matches the misconception of using inappropriate precision (rounding to tenths rather than preserving hundredths).  \n\nThis differs from a \"10cm in a metre\" error (which would yield \\( 2.7\\, \\text{m} \\)) or giving a whole number. The student correctly divided by 100 but added an unnecessary rounding step, conflating unit conversion with approximate measurement reporting.",
