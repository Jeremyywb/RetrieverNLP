  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nPop: 3.5 symbols \u00d7 4 CDs/symbol = 14 CDs\nRock: 2 symbols \u00d7 4 CDs/symbol = 8 CDs\nDifference: 14 - 8 = 6 CDs\n\nStudent's calculation:\n3.5 (Pop) - 2 (Rock) = 1.5 symbols difference\n1.5 \u00d7 3 = 4.5 CDs (assuming partial symbol = 0.5 CD value)\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student subtracted symbol counts first (3.5-2=1.5), then incorrectly multiplied by 3 instead of 4. This suggests they either: \n1) Mistakenly associated half-symbols with 0.5 CD units rather than 0.5\u00d7key value\n2) Assumed fractional results required division by 2 (1.5\u00d74=6 \u2192 6/1.33\u22484.5)\n\nKey distinction:\nThis differs from \"ignores partial symbols\" (which would yield 3-2=1 symbol difference) or \"counts partials as whole\" (which would make 4-2=2). The error specifically stems from mishandling scaled fractions after initial correct symbol subtraction.\n\nThe core failure was maintaining unit consistency - they treated symbol fractions as direct CD quantities rather than scaling them by the key's 4:1 ratio throughout the calculation.",
