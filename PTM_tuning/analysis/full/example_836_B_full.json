  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The pie chart's 8 sections represent 24 people. Red occupies 2/8 (1/4) of the chart. \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 24 = 6 \\).\n\nStudent's error: They concluded \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) as the final answer instead of calculating \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 24 \\).\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student correctly identified the fraction of sections representing red (1/4) but treated this fraction itself as the solution. They failed to recognize that pie chart fractions must be applied to the total population (24) to determine the count.\n\nMisconception link: This directly stems from interpreting the chart's fractional divisions as absolute quantities rather than proportions of the total dataset. The student conflated the graphical representation (sections as fractions) with the final numerical value required.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike angle-based errors or section-counting mistakes, the student properly converted sections to a fraction but omitted the critical step of scaling this fraction to the total frequency (24 people).\n\nThis explanation aligns uniquely with the primary misconception: using the chart's structural fraction (sections) as the answer instead of the quantity it represents.",
