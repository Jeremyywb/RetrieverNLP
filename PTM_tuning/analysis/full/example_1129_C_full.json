  "explanation": "The correct calculation begins at -3 and adds 9 to reach 6: \\(-3 + 9 = 6\\).  \nThe student's answer, \\(6 + 9 = -3\\), reverses the starting and ending temperatures.  \n\nThe student likely misinterpreted the arrow's direction, treating the final temperature (6) as the starting point and adding 9 in the *opposite* direction (left on the number line) to arrive at -3. This reflects a flaw in understanding how addition corresponds to movement on a number line: adding a positive number should move right (increasing), not left.  \n\nThis error aligns with counting in the wrong direction when adding, as the student incorrectly associated the \"+9\" with moving downward (subtracting) from 6 rather than upward (adding) from -3. It is distinct from misconceptions about negative numbers or sum interpretation, as the error specifically involves directional reasoning, not sign handling or sum/difference confusion.",
