  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{s} \\times \\frac{2}{t} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 2}{s \\cdot t} = \\frac{2}{st}\\).  \nStudent's incorrect steps: Treated multiplication as addition, computing \\(\\frac{1 \\cdot t + 2 \\cdot s}{s \\cdot t} = \\frac{t+2s}{st}\\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly combined the numerators using addition instead of multiplication. They applied the formula for *adding* fractions (\\(\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}\\)) to a multiplication problem, cross-adding \\(1 \\cdot t\\) and \\(2 \\cdot s\\). This reflects a confusion between the operations: multiplication requires direct multiplication of numerators/denominators, while addition requires cross-multiplication and summing.  \n\nThe error is distinct from simply \"adding denominators\" or \"multiplying numerators but adding denominators,\" as the denominator here was correctly multiplied (\\(s \\cdot t\\)), but the numerator operation was misapplied. The core flaw was substituting addition rules into a multiplication context.",
