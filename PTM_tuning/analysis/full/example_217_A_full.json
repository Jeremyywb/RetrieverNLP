  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n0.15 = 0.5p  \np = 0.15 \u00f7 0.5  \np = 0.3  \n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n0.15 = 0.5p  \np = 0.15 - 0.5  \np = -0.35  \n\nThe student treated division as subtraction when isolating p. They likely recognized the need to remove the 0.5 coefficient but misapplied subtraction instead of division. This directly substitutes subtraction for division when scaling down, as shown by converting \"0.5 multiplied by p\" to \"0.5 subtracted from 0.15\". \n\nThe error stems from misidentifying the inverse operation required for multiplicative relationships. While related misconceptions involve confusion between additive inverses (e.g., subtraction vs addition), this specifically demonstrates substituting subtraction for division in a proportional scaling context, distinct from errors involving additive equations.",
