This misapplication of inverse operations led to \\(-4 \\leq n\\). To reconcile this with their answer, they likely divided \\(-4\\) by an unrelated coefficient (e.g., 2 from the original \\(2n\\)), inventing a step that doesn't exist in the equation.\n\nConnection to Misconception:\nThis error stems from treating terms on each side as requiring separate, mismatched operations (subtracting 7 on the left, ignoring the right) rather than applying the same operation to both sides. It reflects a failure to maintain equality through balanced operations.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nUnlike errors in coefficient division or term movement, this specifically involves applying contradictory operations (subtraction on one side, no action on the other) instead of uniform steps. The error is rooted in unbalanced term manipulation, not coefficient handling or inequality reversal.",
