  "explanation": "The correct total requires summing all frequency values: 3 (Blue) + 2 (Black) + 4 (Silver) + 1 (Red) + 3 (Other) = 13.  \nThe student likely counted the number of rows in the table (5 distinct colors) instead of summing the frequency values.  \nThis error shows a confusion between the count of data categories (rows) and the arithmetic total of their frequencies.  \nThe misconception directly caused the student to equate the quantity of listed colors (5) with the total cars sold, bypassing the need for addition.  \nThis explanation better fits the error than related misconceptions like column confusion, as the answer matches the row count rather than an incorrect column value or partial sum.",
