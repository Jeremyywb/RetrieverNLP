  "explanation": "The correct sequence follows triangular numbers where each term \\( T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\), producing 1, 3, 6, 10, etc., through cumulative addition. The student incorrectly identified these as cube numbers (e.g., \\( 1^3=1 \\), \\( 2^3=8 \\), \\( 3^3=27 \\)), which grow exponentially. The error arises from misinterpreting the presence of terms like 3, 6, 15, and 21 (which are multiples of 3) as indicative of cube numbers, conflating divisibility by 3 with cubic relationships. This directly aligns with the misconception that cube numbers are \"just multiples of 3,\" despite cube numbers requiring \\( n^3 \\) values (e.g., 8, 27) unrelated to divisibility by 3. The error is distinct from analyzing differences (which increase linearly here) or confusing triangular numbers with squares, as the sequence structure does not match those patterns.",
