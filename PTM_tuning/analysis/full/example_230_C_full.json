  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Convert 5 km to 5000 m. Percentage = (50/5000)\u00d7100 = 1%.\n\nStudent's error: Likely calculated (50/5)\u00d7100 = 1000% but then divided by 20 (arbitrary scaling) to get 50%, or incorrectly treated 5 km as 100 m total (1 km=20 m).\n\nSpecific flaw: Failed to convert km to meters before calculating percentages, treating numerical values 50 and 5 as directly comparable. This caused them to divide 50 by 5 rather than 5000, fundamentally altering the ratio.\n\nMisconception link: Directly corresponds to comparing raw numbers without unit conversion. The student's 50/5 operation shows they treated \"5 km\" as 5 base units rather than 5000 meters.\n\nDistinction: Unlike the \"10m=1km\" misconception (which would yield 500% error), this error stems from unit ignorance, not explicit conversion errors. The answer matches neither raw division (1000%) nor percentage-of-amount errors (e.g., 5% of 50m).",
