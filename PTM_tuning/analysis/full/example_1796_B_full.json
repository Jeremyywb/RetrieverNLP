  "explanation": "Correct approach: Sum of angles in a triangle = 180\u00b0. Let unknown third angle = x. Then 65 + k + x = 180 \u2192 k = 115 - x. Without x's value, k cannot be uniquely determined.\n\nStudent's error: Assuming k = 65\u00b0 implies 65 + 65 + x = 180 \u2192 x = 50\u00b0. This treats the two labeled angles as sufficient to determine k, ignoring the third angle's role.\n\nFlaw: The student neglected the necessity of the third angle in the angle sum calculation. By equating k to the known angle, they arbitrarily fixed the third angle's value (50\u00b0) without justification. This directly stems from failing to recognize that all three angles must collectively sum to 180\u00b0, not just the labeled ones.\n\nDistinction: This is not about misapplying isosceles triangle properties (which would require side equality) or diagram misinterpretation. The error specifically omits the unlabeled angle from the sum calculation, violating the fundamental triangle angle sum rule.",
