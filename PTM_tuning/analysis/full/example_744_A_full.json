  "explanation": "The correct interpretation recognizes that matching arrow symbols indicate parallel lines regardless of length. The student answered \"Equal\" instead of \"Parallel.\" This suggests they associated the arrow notation with line segment equality rather than directional parallelism. The error stems from misattributing the symbol's purpose - interpreting visual markers for orientation (parallelism) as markers for quantitative equality (length). This specific confusion better explains choosing \"Equal\" over \"Parallel\" compared to general vocabulary gaps (not knowing \"parallel\") or length-based parallelism beliefs (which would still require answering \"Parallel\"). The arrows' role as parallelism indicators is distinct from equality notations like hash marks.",
