  "explanation": "To solve \\(\\frac{24}{x} = 6\\), multiplying both sides by \\(x\\) gives \\(24 = 6x\\) (Tom's step). Katie's claim \\(24 = \\frac{x}{6}\\) implies she inverted the original fraction \\(\\frac{24}{x}\\) to \\(\\frac{x}{24}\\) and multiplied by 6, resulting in \\(\\frac{x}{24} \\cdot 6 = \\frac{x}{4} = 6\\), leading to \\(x = 24\\). \n\nThe student assumed both methods isolate \\(x\\) equivalently. The error stems from misapplying reciprocal operations: Katie incorrectly treated \\(\\frac{24}{x} = 6\\) as \\(\\frac{x}{24} = 6\\) by inverting the fraction without properly multiplying both sides by \\(x\\). This directly aligns with confusing reciprocal relationships in equations. \n\nDistinct from dividing-by-6 errors, the flaw lies in improperly manipulating the fraction's structure rather than miscalculating multiplicative inverses. The student conflated fraction inversion with valid algebraic steps to isolate \\(x\\).",
