  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 60 minutes \u00f7 8 = 7.5 minutes.\n\nStudent's likely steps: 100 minutes \u00f7 8 = 12.5 minutes.\n\nThe student incorrectly treated 1 hour as 100 minutes instead of 60. This led them to divide 100 by 8 rather than 60, producing 12.5. While the primary misconception is listed as an arithmetic error in division, the specific 12.5 result better aligns with mistakenly using 100 minutes/hour (a hybrid of decimal system confusion). This differs from multiplying by 80 (which would yield 10) or dividing 50/8 (6.25). The error stems from substituting 100 as the total minutes rather than executing incorrect division steps on 60.",
