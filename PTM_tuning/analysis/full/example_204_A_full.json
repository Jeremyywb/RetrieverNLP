  "explanation": "The correct calculation parses 204050 as 204 (thousand) + 050, forming \"two hundred four thousand fifty.\" The student incorrectly segmented the number as \"two million\" (2,000,000) + \"four thousand\" (4,000) + \"fifty\" (50), totaling 2,004,050. \n\nThe error stems from misattributing the first digit (2) to the millions place instead of the hundred thousands. The student treated the six-digit number as if its leftmost digit occupied a seven-digit number's millions position, creating an erroneous \"two million\" interpretation. \n\nThis directly aligns with place value confusion but specifically at the hundred thousands/millions level, not the hundreds/thousands mixup listed as a related misconception. The error isn't caused by right-to-left reading or spacing issues but by misjudging the magnitude of the leftmost digit's position.",
