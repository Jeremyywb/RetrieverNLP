  "explanation": "The correct perimeter calculation for a rectangle uses the formula \\( 2a + 2b \\), derived from doubling the sum of one pair of adjacent sides (since opposite sides are equal). The student's claim of \"not enough information\" implies they failed to recognize that the labeled sides \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) define all four sides of the rectangle. \n\nThe error stems from a misunderstanding of rectangle properties: the student likely assumed only the explicitly labeled lengths (one \\( a \\), one \\( b \\)) were available for calculation, rather than inferring there are two pairs of equal sides. This directly connects to the misconception about rectangle side relationships, where the equality of opposite sides wasn't applied to compensate for unlabeled lengths. \n\nThis explanation better fits the error than related misconceptions like \"only labeled dimensions need inclusion,\" as the student didn't omit specific labeled values but instead rejected the problem's solvability entirely. The failure to recall the fundamental rectangle property (opposite sides equal) prevented them from progressing beyond the given labels.",
