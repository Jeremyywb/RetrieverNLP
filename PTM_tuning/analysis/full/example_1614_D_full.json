  "explanation": "The correct equation \\( y = 1 - 4x \\) has a slope of \\(-4\\) (negative) and a y-intercept of \\(1\\) (positive). The student's answer incorrectly shows a negative y-intercept. \n\nThe student likely identified the slope correctly as \\(-4\\) from the \\(-4x\\) term but erroneously treated the coefficient of \\(x\\) as the y-intercept. This indicates they conflated the roles of the slope and intercept in the equation \\(y = mx + b\\). \n\nBy misassigning the \\(-4\\) (intended as the slope) to the y-intercept, they concluded the intercept was \\(-4\\) instead of \\(1\\). This directly stems from treating the slope and intercept as interchangeable quantities. \n\nThe error is distinct from confusing the sign of the constant term (e.g., misreading \\(1\\) as \\(-1\\)) or misapplying the equation's structure, as the mistake specifically involves mislabeling the slope value as the intercept.",
