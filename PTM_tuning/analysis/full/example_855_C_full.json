  "explanation": "Correct Calculation: \nNumerator: 5 \u00d7 x\u00b2 = 5x\u00b2  \nDenominator: (x-3) \u00d7 2y = 2y(x-3)  \nResult: \\(\\frac{5x^2}{2y(x-3)}\\)\n\nStudent's Error:  \nThey combined denominators as \\(x - 6y\\), likely calculating \\((x-3) \u00d7 2y\\) incorrectly as \\(x - (3\u00d72y)\\) instead of \\(2y(x-3)\\).\n\nFlawed Reasoning:  \nThe student treated multiplication with \\(2y\\) as subtraction of \\(6y\\) from \\(x\\), ignoring the distributive property. They incorrectly simplified \\(2y(x-3)\\) to \\(x - 6y\\) by multiplying only the constant term (-3) by \\(2y\\) and leaving the \\(x\\) term unmodified.\n\nMisconception Link:  \nThis reflects a failure to distribute \\(2y\\) across both terms in \\((x-3)\\), specifically neglecting to multiply \\(2y\\) by \\(x\\). The error isn't about cancelling variables or partial expansion of brackets, but about mishandling multiplicative distribution.\n\nDistinction:  \nUnlike errors about cancelling unlike terms or partial bracket expansion, this mistake stems from misapplying multiplication to a binomial. The student incorrectly treated the product \\(2y\u00d7x\\) as \\(x\\) rather than \\(2xy\\).",
