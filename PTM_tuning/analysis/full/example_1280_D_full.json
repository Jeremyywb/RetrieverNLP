  "explanation": "The correct answer requires knowing \"decagon\" uses the Greek prefix \"deca-\" for ten. The student selected \"dodecagon,\" which uses \"dodeca-\" meaning twelve. \n\nThe error occurs in prefix identification: the student substituted \"dodeca-\" (twelve) for \"deca-\" (ten). This stems from confusion between Greek numerical prefixes for adjacent decades (10 vs. 12) rather than Latin/Greek mixing (e.g., \"decem\" vs. \"deca\"). \n\nThe error is isolated to prefix misinterpretation, not arithmetic operations (like interior angle calculations) or number sequencing (\"dozen\" vs. \"ten\"), as no numerical values require computation or ordering in the naming convention. The substitution specifically reflects misapplied prefix knowledge rather than broader place value or arithmetic flaws.",
