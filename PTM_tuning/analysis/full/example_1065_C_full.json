  "explanation": "The correct equation for a horizontal line through (0,-2) is \\( y = -2 \\), where all points share this y-coordinate. The student wrote \\( xy = -2 \\), incorrectly introducing a product of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). This suggests they believed both variables must appear in the equation, despite horizontal lines being independent of \\( x \\). The error directly stems from including \\( x \\) inappropriately, violating the principle that horizontal lines are defined solely by a constant \\( y \\)-value. This distinguishes it from misconceptions about gradients or equations like \\( x = ay \\), as the student combined variables multiplicatively rather than misassigning the intercept or slope.",
