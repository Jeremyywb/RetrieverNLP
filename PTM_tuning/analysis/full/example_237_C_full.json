  "explanation": "The correct expansion is \\((p-3)(p+3) = p^2 - 9\\), where the constant term arises from \\(-3 \\times +3 = -9\\). The student incorrectly concluded \\(+9\\), likely interpreting \\(-3 \\times +3\\) as equivalent to \\((-3)^2\\). This stems from conflating multiplication with squaring, assuming the negative applies to both terms as in \\((-3)^2 = +9\\), rather than computing \\(- (3 \\times 3)\\). \n\nThis aligns with misapplying sign rules for squares to a multiplication of distinct terms. Unlike errors from omitting terms or adding instead of subtracting, the student specifically misattributed the product's sign due to an incorrect association with squared negatives, not merely arithmetic oversight. The error reflects a confusion between operations (multiplication vs. exponentiation) rather than incomplete expansion or basic sign mismanagement.",
