  "explanation": "The correct Fibonacci sequence definition requires each term after the first two to be the sum of the two preceding terms. Tom's sequence (1,1,2,3,5,8...) follows this with starting terms 1,1. Katie's sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13...) also follows the rule with starting terms 1,2. Both are valid because Fibonacci sequences can begin with any two numbers. \n\nThe student likely rejected Katie's sequence because her starting terms (1,2) differ, incorrectly assuming the first two terms must be identical. This shows a misunderstanding that Fibonacci sequences are defined solely by the recurrence relation, not by specific initial values. \n\nThe error stems from imposing an unwarranted restriction on the starting terms, rather than misapplying the summation rule or misnumbering terms. This differentiates it from related misconceptions about pattern identification or sequence numbering.",
