  "explanation": "The correct denominator calculates the number of ways to pick 3 balls without replacement: \\(7 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 210\\). \n\nThe student likely multiplied \\(7 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 343\\), treating each pick as independent with replacement. \n\nThe error stems from failing to reduce the denominator after each pick, assuming the total number of balls remains 7 for all selections. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of not adjusting denominators for non-replacement scenarios, as the student maintained a constant denominator instead of decrementing it (7\u21926\u21925). \n\nIt differs from \"uses total sample space as denominator\" because the student didn't use a single combination count (e.g., \\(\\binom{7}{3}\\)) but incorrectly applied replacement logic. \n\nThe error is distinct from \"including too many possibilities\" because the flaw isn't overcounting permutations vs. combinations but misapplying replacement rules.",
