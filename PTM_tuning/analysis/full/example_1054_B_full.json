  "explanation": "Correct Calculation: Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes)/(Total outcomes) = 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%\n\nStudent's Likely Error: Calculated 2/5 instead of 1/4, resulting in 0.4 = 40%\n\nReasoning Flaw: The student treated the spinner's labels (1,2,3,4) as frequency counts rather than distinct outcomes. By summing all labels (1+2+3+4=10), they used this total as the denominator instead of the 4 distinct sections. This made them calculate probability as 2/10 (for label \"2\") = 20% or 4/10 (for section count) = 40%, both misapplying the denominator.\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"wrong-way-around\" percentage calculation (which would yield 400% for 4/1) or numerator-denominator concatenation (which would produce 14% for 1/4). The error specifically stems from using summed label values rather than outcome count.\n\nThe misconception caused the student to: 1) Misidentify the total possible outcomes as 10 (summed numbers) instead of 4 (sections), 2) Create a non-uniform probability framework unrelated to the spinner's geometry.",
