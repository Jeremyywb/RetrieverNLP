  "explanation": "The correct calculation first applies \\( x \\times 5 \\), then subtracts that result from 8:  \n\\( 8 - 5x \\).  \n\nThe student's incorrect answer \\( 5x - 8 \\) reverses the order of subtraction. This occurs because they treated the second step as \"subtract 8\" rather than \"subtract the previous result from 8.\"  \n\nThe flaw stems from misinterpreting the directional nature of subtraction. The phrase \"subtracted from 8\" requires writing \\( 8 - (\\text{result}) \\), but the student applied subtraction as \\( (\\text{result}) - 8 \\).  \n\nThis directly aligns with misapplying subtraction's non-commutative property. The error is distinct from left-to-right operation priority, as the machine's arrows explicitly define sequential steps. The student followed the steps but inverted the subtraction operands, not the operation order itself.",
