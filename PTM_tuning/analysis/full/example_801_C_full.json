  "explanation": "The correct calculation subtracts grade 1's frequency from grade 5's: \\(10 - 4 = 6\\).  \nThe student likely took the frequency value for grade 5 (\\(10\\)) directly as the answer without comparing it to grade 1.  \n\nThe error stems from interpreting \"how many more\" as a request for a single value rather than a difference. The student isolated the grade 5 frequency but neglected to perform subtraction, indicating a failure to recognize that \"how many more\" requires relational comparison.  \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of finding a total instead of a difference, as the answer matches a raw frequency value. It differs from column confusion (which would involve misreading the table headers) or addition errors (since no sum is present in the answer).",
