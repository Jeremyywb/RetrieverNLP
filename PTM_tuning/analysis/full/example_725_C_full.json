  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \nOutput = Input - 3  \n7 = x - 3  \nx = 7 + 3 = 10  \n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:  \n4 - 3 = 1 (incorrect intermediate step)  \nMistakenly concluding 7 - 3 = 4  \n\nThe student incorrectly applied subtraction (the original function's operation) to the output value 7 instead of reversing it. They treated the output as if it were the result of subtracting 3 from their answer (4 - 3 = 1), but this doesn't align with the given output of 7. The error stems from executing the same operation (subtraction) instead of using the inverse operation (addition) to solve for the unknown input.  \n\nThis directly matches the \"same operation\" misconception rather than input/output confusion, as the student recognized the operation but failed to invert it. It differs from \"subtracts instead of adds\" because the error occurred during equation solving, not operational choice.",
