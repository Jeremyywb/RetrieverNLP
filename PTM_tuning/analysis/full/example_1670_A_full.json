  "explanation": "The correct volume calculation requires multiplying the area of the triangular base (\u00bd\u00d7base\u00d7height) by the prism's depth. The student incorrectly selected the rectangular face formed by the hypotenuse and depth. They likely multiplied hypotenuse length \u00d7 depth (slanted rectangle area) instead of using the triangle's area. This indicates they conflated the cross-section (triangle) with lateral faces (rectangles) in the prism volume formula. The error aligns with treating a non-cross-section face as the base area, distinct from related height/base misconceptions. The student's reasoning mistakenly associates volume with a composite rectangular face rather than isolating the triangular cross-section.",
