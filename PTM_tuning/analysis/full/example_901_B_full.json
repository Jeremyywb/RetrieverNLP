  "explanation": "The expression \\(3p + 7\\) contains two terms: \\(3p\\) and \\(7\\). The symbol \\(p\\) is a variable within the first term. The student incorrectly identified \\(p\\) as a \"term,\" conflating the variable itself with the entire expression \\(3p\\). This stems from misunderstanding that a term must include both the coefficient and variable (or a constant), not just the variable alone. The error aligns with confusing components of terms with full terms themselves, rather than misclassifying the entire expression or misusing informal language. Related misconceptions like confusing expressions with terms don't apply here, as the question focuses on identifying \\(p\\) specifically.",
