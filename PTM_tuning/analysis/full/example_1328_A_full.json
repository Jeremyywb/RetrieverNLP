  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (3+4+3+4+4)/5 = 18/5 = 3.6  \nStudent's error: 18 \u00f7 6 = 3  \n\nThe student correctly summed the values but divided by 6 instead of 5. This suggests they miscounted the number of values, likely adding an extra nonexistent data point. The error stems from misunderstanding how to determine the divisor in the mean formula, specifically failing to count the actual quantity of numbers.  \n\nThis differs from confusing mean with mode/median (which would yield 4) or dividing 1 by the number of values. The student's specific flaw was misapplying the denominator, not conflating measures of central tendency.",
