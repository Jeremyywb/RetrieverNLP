  "explanation": "To determine common factors of \\(6x\\) and \\(9y\\):\n- Correct: \\(3\\) divides both coefficients \\(6\\) and \\(9\\), making it a common factor. \n- Incorrect: \\(x\\) cannot divide \\(9y\\) because \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are distinct variables.\n\nThe student likely assumed \\(x\\) is a common factor because it appears in \\(6x\\), without verifying its presence in \\(9y\\). This misapplies the definition of a common factor, which requires the factor to divide both terms. The error stems from treating \\(x\\) as a valid factor for \\(9y\\) despite its absence, mistaking partial presence for universality. \n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception of \"incorrectly identifying an incomplete variable factor,\" as the student focused on \\(x\\) in one term but neglected to check the second term. It differs from \"ignores numerical coefficients entirely,\" since the student correctly recognized \\(3\\) as a numerical common factor.",
