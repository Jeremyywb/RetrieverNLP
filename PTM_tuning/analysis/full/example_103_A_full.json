  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 10\\,\\text{cm} \\times 3\\,\\text{cm} = 30\\,\\text{cm}^2 \\).  \nIncorrect calculation: \\( 10\\,\\text{cm} \\times 4\\,\\text{cm} \\times 3\\,\\text{cm} = 120\\,\\text{cm}^2 \\).  \n\nThe student treated the area formula as requiring multiplication of all given dimensions (base, slant height, perpendicular height) instead of recognizing that only base and perpendicular height are needed. This reflects a belief that all labeled measurements must be used in area calculations.  \n\nThe error differs from using the slant height alone (which would yield \\( 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\)) or misapplying a triangle formula. The inclusion of all three values explicitly demonstrates the misconception of over-inclusion, not substitution of height types.",
