  "explanation": "The correct calculation counts each section as a distinct outcome, yielding \\(6\\) possible outcomes. \n\nThe student answered \\(1\\), implying they interpreted \"possible outcomes\" as the result of a single spin rather than the total distinct outcomes available. \n\nThis error stems from conflating the number of outcomes observed in one trial (which is always \\(1\\)) with the total number of possible distinct outcomes (which requires counting all sections). \n\nThe misconception directly caused the student to fixate on the singular result of spinning once, rather than enumerating all potential results. \n\nThis differs from counting unique label values (which would yield \\(3\\)) or miscounting sections (which would involve misidentifying the spinner's structure). \n\nThe error is uniquely tied to misinterpreting the question's scope as a single trial's result, not the full set of possibilities.",
