  "explanation": "To round 5050 to the nearest 10:  \n**Correct calculation**: The ones digit is 0 (505**0**), which is less than 5, so the tens place (5**5**0) remains unchanged. Result: 5050.  \n\n**Student's error**: They likely treated the thousands place (the first \"5\" in 5**0**50) as the rounding digit instead of the ones place. By focusing on the first digit, they rounded 5050 to 5000 as if approximating to one significant figure.  \n\n**Flaw**: The student confused rounding to the nearest 10 (place-value rounding) with rounding to 1 significant figure. They incorrectly prioritized the magnitude of the number (5000s) over evaluating the specific digit (ones place) required for rounding to the nearest 10.  \n\n**Connection to misconception**: This directly aligns with conflating significant figures with place-value rounding, not truncation or misidentifying the rounding digit (e.g., mistaking the tens for ones). The error stems from misapplying the rule for significant figures to a place-value rounding task.  \n\n**Distinction**: Unlike truncation (removing digits) or rounding to 100s, the error specifically substitutes a significant-figure rule (focusing on the leftmost digit) for the required place-value analysis.",
