  "explanation": "The correct solution recognizes that a uniform rectangular cross-section implies a prism with rectangular faces along its length - a cuboid. The student incorrectly selected \"cube,\" which requires all edges equal (square cross-sections). \n\nThe student likely reasoned: \"rectangles appear in cubes too\" (valid for square cross-sections), but failed to distinguish between squares (special case) vs general rectangles. This shows they conflated square cross-sections with rectangular ones under the \"uniform cross-section\" requirement. \n\nThe primary misconception manifests here as misidentifying cross-sectional shape specificity - treating \"rectangle\" as inclusive of squares when the problem context implies distinctness (since cubes are cuboids, but only non-square cuboids have non-square rectangular cross-sections). This directly matches the cross-section confusion listed, not the face-naming or terminology issues. \n\nThe error stems from not recognizing that while squares are rectangles, the uniform cross-section specification here requires excluding shapes with more restrictive cross-sections (cubes) unless explicitly stated. The student overgeneralized the rectangle/square relationship in a context requiring dimensional differentiation.",
