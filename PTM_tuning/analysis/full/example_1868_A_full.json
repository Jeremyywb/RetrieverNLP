  "explanation": "To determine the correct rotation from shape P to Q:\n1. Correct calculation requires identifying the center (-1,1) and recognizing that a 90\u00b0 anticlockwise rotation is equivalent to a +270\u00b0 rotation about that center.\n\n2. The student incorrectly accepted Jo's \"90\u00b0 anticlockwise\" without specifying the center. This implies they assumed the rotation was about the origin (0,0), as Jo's description lacks a center point.\n\n3. The error stems from assuming rotations default to the origin. The problem explicitly shows the center at (-1,1), which Paul correctly included. Jo's answer is incomplete due to the missing center, but the student treated it as valid by ignoring the center requirement.\n\n4. This directly aligns with the misconception that the center is always the origin. The student didn\u2019t verify the marked center, leading them to accept an incomplete description.\n\n5. This differs from direction-related misconceptions because both 90\u00b0 anticlockwise and +270\u00b0 are mathematically equivalent. The error is purely about the center specification, not direction or angle equivalence.",
