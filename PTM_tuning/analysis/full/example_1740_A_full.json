  "explanation": "The line of symmetry for \\( y=(x+1)(x-3) \\) is found by averaging the roots \\( x=-1 \\) and \\( x=3 \\), yielding \\( x=1 \\). The student incorrectly identified \\( y=-3 \\), which corresponds to the y-intercept of the parabola (found by setting \\( x=0 \\) in the equation). This shows they confused the vertical line of symmetry (requiring x-coordinate calculation) with the y-intercept value (a y-coordinate). The misconception involves conflating intercepts with symmetry properties of graphs. This differs from related errors about line orientation because the error stems from misidentifying the quantity being sought (symmetry axis vs. intercept), not from axis-label confusion or misunderstanding line directionality.",
