  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{p \\times 12}{2} = 36 \\) \u2192 \\( p \\times 6 = 36 \\) \u2192 \\( p = 6 \\).  \nStudent's likely calculation: \\( p \\times 12 = 36 \\) \u2192 \\( p = 3 \\).  \n\nThe student omitted division by 2 in the area formula, treating the triangle as if it required a full base\u00d7height rectangle (72 cm\u00b2) rather than half. This caused them to solve \\( 12p = 36 \\) instead of \\( \\frac{12p}{2} = 36 \\).  \n\nThis matches the misconception of not dividing by 2 in the area formula. It differs from \"doubling instead of halving\" (which would produce \\( p = 12 \\)), and there\u2019s no evidence they assumed height bisects the base, as the problem doesn\u2019t imply symmetry. The error stems directly from mishandling the formula\u2019s division step.",
