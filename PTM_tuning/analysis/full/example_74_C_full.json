  "explanation": "The correct equation \\( t^{2} = -45 \\) has no real solutions because squaring any real \\( t \\) yields a non-negative result. The student incorrectly identified \\( t^{3} = -45 \\) as having no real solutions. \n\nCubic equations of the form \\( t^{3} = k \\) always have exactly one real solution (e.g., \\( t = \\sqrt[3]{-45} \\)) because cube roots of negative numbers are real. The student likely conflated the behavior of even and odd exponents, assuming both \\( t^{2} \\) and \\( t^{3} \\) equations with negative constants would lack real solutions. This directly stems from misunderstanding how exponent parity affects real solutions, rather than confusion about quadratic terminology or square root definitions. Unlike the related misconception about square roots of negatives, this error specifically misapplies properties of cubic functions.",
