  "explanation": "The correct reflection maps each point \\((a, b)\\) in \\(P\\) to \\((b, a)\\) in \\(Q\\), confirming the line \\(y = x\\). For example, \\((2,5) \\rightarrow (5,2)\\) and \\((2,8) \\rightarrow (8,2)\\).\n\nThe student likely calculated \\(y = \\frac{\\text{max}(P_y) + \\text{min}(Q_y)}{2} = \\frac{8 + 2}{2} = 5\\) or averaged \\(P\\)'s midpoint \\(y\\)-value (e.g., \\(\\frac{5+8}{2} = 6.5\\)) with \\(Q\\)'s, but misapplied midpoint calculations to derive \\(y = 4.5\\).\n\nThe error stems from treating reflection as a vertical flip over a horizontal line, ignoring coordinate swaps. This conflates vertical reflection (which preserves \\(x\\)-coordinates) with diagonal reflection over \\(y = x\\) (which swaps \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)). \n\nThe misconception is distinct from confusing horizontal/vertical lines (\\(x = k\\) vs. \\(y = k\\)) or general mirror line identification failures, as the student specifically attempted to calculate a horizontal line through averaged coordinates.",
