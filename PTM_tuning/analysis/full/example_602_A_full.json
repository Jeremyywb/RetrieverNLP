  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 30 = \\frac{30}{5} \\times 3 = 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\).\n\nStudent's likely calculation: \\( \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\), stopping here without multiplying by 3.\n\nThe error occurs when the student treats \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) as equivalent to \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\), failing to multiply the quotient (6) by the numerator (3). This shows confusion between non-unit fractions (which require scaling) and unit fractions (which don't). The answer matches exactly what would happen if only the denominator were used, distinguishing it from whole-amount errors or unit price issues. The student recognized the need to divide by 5 but omitted the critical step of taking 3 parts of the whole.",
