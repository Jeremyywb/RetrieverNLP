  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Height at 50s (55m) - height at 20s (30m) = 25m.\n\nStudent's error: Used the height at 50s (55m) directly as the answer without subtracting the height at 20s.\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student treated the final height value as the total distance traveled during the interval, rather than computing the difference between the final and initial heights. This occurred because they conflated the absolute height at the end time with the net change required by the question.\n\nMisconception link: This directly stems from failing to recognize that distance traveled between two times requires subtracting the starting height from the ending height. The student incorrectly equated \"height at 50s\" with \"distance traveled from 20s to 50s.\"\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: This is not a case of adding values (e.g., 30+55) or misreading axes. The student correctly identified the final height value but misapplied it by omitting the subtraction step entirely, unlike area-under-the-graph or axis-switching errors.",
