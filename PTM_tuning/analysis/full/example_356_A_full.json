  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nThe number line ranges from 100 to 200. Assuming equal divisions, each dash represents 10 units. The arrow points to the 6th dash after 100:  \n\\(100 + (6 \\times 10) = 160\\).\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\nIf the student assumed each dash equals 1 unit, they might have counted 54 dashes from 100:  \n\\(100 + 54 = 154\\).\n\nReasoning Flaw:\nThe student misapplied the scale by treating each dash as a 1-unit increment instead of recognizing the interval size (10 units). This caused them to add 54 directly to 100 rather than calculating \\(100 + (6 \\times 10)\\).\n\nConnection to Misconception:\nThe error directly stems from failing to account for the division width (10 units per dash). The student counted dashes as single units rather than scaled intervals.\n\nDistinguishing from Related Misconceptions:\nThis is distinct from counting dashes in the wrong direction or miscounting intervals. The core issue was misinterpreting the scale, not directional counting or omitting a dash.",
