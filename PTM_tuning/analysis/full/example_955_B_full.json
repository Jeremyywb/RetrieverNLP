  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nAt first minute (x=1): y=1 cm\nAt third minute (x=3): y=6 cm\nDifference: 6 cm - 1 cm = 5 cm\n\nStudent's error:\nUsed y=0 cm (x=0) instead of y=1 cm (x=1) for \"first minute\"\nCalculated 6 cm - 0 cm = 6 cm\n\nFlawed reasoning:\nThe student interpreted \"first minute\" as the starting point before any time elapsed (x=0) rather than the measurement after one full minute (x=1). This caused them to select (0,0) instead of (1,1) for the first minute's value.\n\nMisconception link:\nThis specifically demonstrates using the wrong data point by misapplying temporal references to x-axis positions. The student conflated the beginning of a time interval with its endpoint measurement.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThe axes were correctly labeled and interpreted (ruling out axis confusion), and the graph type was understood (ruling out relationship misunderstanding). The error strictly involved incorrect point selection.",
