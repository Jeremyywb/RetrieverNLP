  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \nSolving \\(3n + 1 = 82\\) yields \\(n = 27\\), confirming 82 is the 27th term since \\(n\\) must be a whole number.\n\nStudent's error: \nThe student claims Eliza's algebraic method doesn't answer whether 82 is in the sequence.\n\nFlaw in reasoning: \nThe student likely failed to recognize that solving for \\(n\\) directly validates the term's existence in an explicit sequence formula (\\(3n+1\\)). This indicates they conflated term-to-term rules (e.g., \"add 3\") with the explicit positional formula, assuming verification requires iterative term generation instead of algebraic confirmation.\n\nConnection to misconception: \nThe error stems from misunderstanding how sequences are defined and validated. The student treated the problem as requiring a recursive process (like checking each term) rather than using the given explicit formula's inverse operation.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: \nThis isn't about arithmetic errors or term-value multiplication but specifically misapplying sequence definition types (explicit vs. recursive). The student recognized the formula but not its purpose for direct validation.",
