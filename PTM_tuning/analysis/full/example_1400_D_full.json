  "explanation": "To determine a fraction between \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) (0.2) and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) (0.25), one could calculate their average: \\( \\frac{\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{4}}{2} = \\frac{9}{40} \\). The student incorrectly concluded no such fraction exists. \n\nThe error stems from treating denominators as ordinal indicators of value rather than understanding their inverse relationship to fraction size. By assuming fractions with denominators 4 and 5 are adjacent numerical values (since 4 and 5 are consecutive integers), the student failed to recognize that equivalent fractions like \\( \\frac{8}{40} \\) and \\( \\frac{10}{40} \\) create intermediate positions (e.g., \\( \\frac{9}{40} \\)).\n\nThis misconception differs from decimal conversion errors (which would involve incorrect place values) or ordering mixups (which would reverse comparisons without denying intermediate values). The core issue is misinterpreting denominator magnitude as directly proportional to fraction magnitude.",
