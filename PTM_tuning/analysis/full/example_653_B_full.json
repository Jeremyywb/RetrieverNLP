  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Identify first significant figure: 8 in 0.00809\n- Next digit is 0 (\u22644), so 8 remains\n- Result: 0.008\n\nStudent's incorrect reasoning:\n- Treated \"round to 1 significant figure\" as rounding to the ones place (nearest integer)\n- Interpreted 0.00809 as approximately 0.008, then rounded this to 0 as the nearest whole number\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student conflated rounding to a specific decimal place (ones place) with rounding to significant figures. They failed to recognize that the first significant figure (8) occupies the thousandths place, requiring rounding to the fourth decimal position rather than truncating to an integer. This misapplication of place value caused them to discard all decimal precision entirely.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nWhile truncating would result in 0.008, the student's answer (0) shows they applied integer rounding rules rather than merely cutting digits. This distinguishes it from truncation or dropping decimals without place value consideration.\n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting \"1 significant figure\" as requiring conversion to whole-number magnitude rather than maintaining relative scale through proper decimal positioning.",
