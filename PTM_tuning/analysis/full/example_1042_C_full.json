  "explanation": "Correct solution:\nSet each factor equal to zero:\n1) 5x + 2 = 0 \u2192 x = -2/5\n2) 2x - 5 = 0 \u2192 x = 5/2\n\nStudent's incorrect solutions:\nTom: 2/5 (wrong sign)\nKatie: -5/2 (wrong value)\n\nThe student likely treated the terms as \"number being moved\" rather than solving equations through inverse operations. For 5x + 2 = 0, they may have incorrectly written x = 2/5 by moving the 2 without changing its sign. For 2x - 5 = 0, they might have subtracted 5 from both sides (2x = -5) instead of adding 5, then divided correctly. This shows a failure to apply inverse operations systematically, where the student preserves the original term's sign when moving it across the equals sign rather than performing balanced operations. \n\nThis directly corresponds to the first listed misconception (using same operation rather than inverse), not the others. The error stems from flawed equation solving technique, not sign confusion in division or symmetry assumptions.",
