  "explanation": "The correct reasoning shows both \u03c0 and 1/\u03c0 are irrational: \u03c0 cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers, and reciprocals of irrationals remain irrational. The student incorrectly assumed \\( \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\) is rational because it is written as a fraction. Their error stems from conflating the general form of a fraction (numerator/denominator) with the requirement that rational numbers specifically require both numerator and denominator to be integers. This directly links to misapplying the definition of a rational number, as \u03c0 is not an integer. The misconception differs from confusing numerator/denominator order (e.g., thinking \\( \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\) represents \u03c0/1) or misjudging repeating decimals, as the error centers on misidentifying the components of a rational fraction.",
