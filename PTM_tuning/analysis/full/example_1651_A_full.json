  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes that both shapes meet the definition of a parallelogram: opposite sides equal and parallel. Tom's rhombus (all sides equal, no right angles) and Katie's rectangle (opposite sides equal, right angles) are both specific types of parallelograms.\n\nThe student incorrectly excluded Katie's rectangle. They likely concluded that right angles disqualify the shape from being a parallelogram, focusing on the rectangle's right angles rather than its inherent parallelogram properties (opposite sides equal/parallel). This shows they treated \"rectangle\" as mutually exclusive with \"parallelogram\" rather than recognizing hierarchical classification.\n\nThis error aligns most directly with the misconception that a shape cannot have multiple valid classifications (e.g., rectangle and parallelogram). While \"right angles disqualify\" is related, the key failure here is the inability to recognize that specialized categories (rectangle) inherit properties from broader categories (parallelogram), not specifically about angle prohibitions.\n\nThe student's reasoning diverged at the point of categorization: they applied an \"either/or\" framework rather than a hierarchical classification system where rectangles satisfy both their specific properties and the general parallelogram definition.",
