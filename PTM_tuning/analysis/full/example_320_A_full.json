  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n1. Split into two rectangles:\n   - First rectangle: 10 cm \u00d7 3 cm = 30 cm\u00b2\n   - Second rectangle: 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm = 12 cm\u00b2\n   (Missing 3 cm side deduced from 7 cm - 4 cm)\n2. Total area: 30 + 12 = 42 cm\u00b2\n\nStudent's Likely Error:\nMultiplied all labeled dimensions: 10 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 = 840 cm\u00b2\n\nFlaw Analysis:\nThe student treated all given side lengths as independent dimensions of a single rectangle rather than recognizing the composite structure. This led them to multiply all four values (10\u00d77\u00d73\u00d74) instead of identifying pairs of length-width dimensions for separate rectangles and summing their areas. The error stems from misapplying multiplication to all available numbers rather than strategically decomposing the shape. This aligns with \"multiplies rather than adds\" (incorrectly multiplying unrelated dimensions) rather than \"adds instead of multiplies\" (using addition for individual rectangle areas). The magnitude of the error confirms this specific multiplicative misapplication rather than a missing-length calculation issue.",
