  "explanation": "The correct solution requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 15. The LCM of 18 (2\u00d73\u00b2) and 15 (3\u00d75) is 90, achieved through 2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75. This ensures Sophie buys 5 packets of rolls (90/18) and 6 packets of hot dogs (90/15).\n\nThe student incorrectly calculated 18 + 15 = 33. This sum does not represent a quantity divisible by both 18 and 15, as 33 \u00f7 18 \u2248 1.83 and 33 \u00f7 15 = 2.2 (neither whole numbers). The error stems from misinterpreting \"same number\" as requiring a sum of the quantities per packet, rather than a shared multiple. The student conflated additive combination with multiplicative commonality, directly causing the invalid result. This aligns with the primary misconception of adding terms instead of seeking a common multiple, distinct from errors like confusing HCF with addition, as the problem explicitly requires equivalence in total counts, not a shared divisor.",
