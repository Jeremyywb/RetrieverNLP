  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Area = (base \u00d7 height)/2 = (5 \u00d7 2)/2 = 5.\n\nStudent's error: The student concluded there was insufficient information despite being given the triangle's base (5) and height (2). This suggests they failed to recognize these values directly correspond to the formula's required inputs.\n\nFlaw: The student likely assumed missing information because they didn't connect the given grid-based right angle with the formula's parameters. A right-angled triangle's legs inherently serve as base and height, but the student may have mistakenly sought additional measurements like grid coordinates or side lengths unrelated to the area formula.\n\nDistinction: This differs from not knowing the formula itself (they might have recalled \"base \u00d7 height\" but didn't identify which quantities qualified) or counting squares (the answer matches the formula's output, not manual counting).\n\nThe misconception stems from not recognizing that grid alignment and right angles define measurable base/height without needing explicit numeric labels for every dimension.",
