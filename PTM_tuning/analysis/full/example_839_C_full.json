  "explanation": "To correctly compare 76426 and 76462, the first differing digit occurs in the tens place: 2 (tens) vs. 6 (tens). Since 2 < 6, 76426 < 76462. For 76462 vs. 74662, the first differing digit is in the thousands place: 6 vs. 4, so 76462 > 74662.\n\nThe student incorrectly compared 76426 and 76462 by focusing on the ones digits (6 vs. 2) instead of the tens place where the numbers actually differ. This caused them to write 76426 > 76462. Their reasoning prioritized the final digit over the earlier, significant digits, ignoring the left-to-right comparison rule. \n\nThis aligns with misapplying digit comparison from the end rather than identifying the first differing digit from the left. It differs from symbol confusion (they correctly used \">\" in the second comparison) or place-value neglect (they recognized digit positions but selected the wrong one to compare).",
