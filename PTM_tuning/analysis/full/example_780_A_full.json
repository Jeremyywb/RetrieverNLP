  "explanation": "The correct answer identifies a rhombus as the quadrilateral with four equal sides. The student incorrectly selected \"arrowhead,\" which only has two pairs of adjacent equal sides. \n\nThe error stems from the student conflating the properties of a rhombus with those of an arrowhead. While a rhombus is defined by having four equal sides (and being a parallelogram), the student likely associated the term \"arrowhead\" with equal-sided shapes without verifying its actual geometric properties. This directly aligns with the misconception of not knowing a rhombus has equal sides, as the student failed to connect the rhombus definition to the problem's requirement. \n\nThe error is distinct from angle-related misconceptions (e.g., regular shapes requiring equal angles) because the question solely concerns side equality. The student's confusion specifically relates to misidentifying the quadrilateral term for equal sides, not overlooking angles or regularity criteria.",
