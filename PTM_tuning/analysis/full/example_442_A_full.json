  "explanation": "Correct Calculation: \\(50 \\times 20 = (5 \\times 10) \\times (2 \\times 10) = 10 \\times 100 = 1000\\).\n\nStudent's Likely Calculation: \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\), ignoring the two zeros in \\(50\\) and the one zero in \\(20\\).\n\nFlaw: The student treated \\(50\\) and \\(20\\) as single-digit numbers (5 and 2), multiplying only the digits without accounting for the place value (tens). This caused them to omit all three zeros required in the product.\n\nConnection to Misconception: They failed to recognize that multiplying multiples of ten requires combining the digits and the total number of zeros from both factors. The error stems from reducing the problem to digit multiplication alone.\n\nDistinction: This isn't a case of adding (which would produce \\(70\\)) or omitting a single zero (which might yield \\(100\\)). The error specifically involves ignoring all place-value zeros during multiplication.",
