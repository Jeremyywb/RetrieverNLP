  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 11 \\times 8 = 44 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\(11 \\times 8 \\times 13 = 1144 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\).  \n\nThe student multiplied all three given dimensions (base, height, hypotenuse) instead of using only the base and height. This occurred because they treated the triangle's area as requiring all side lengths rather than recognizing that the hypotenuse is irrelevant for area calculations in right triangles. The error directly stems from treating the problem as a three-dimensional volume calculation (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height) rather than a two-dimensional area.  \n\nThis distinguishes from the \"does not divide by 2\" misconception, which would yield \\(88 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\), not \\(1144\\). The inclusion of the hypotenuse confirms the flaw was about misidentifying required dimensions, not just omitting division by 2.",
