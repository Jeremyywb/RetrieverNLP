  "explanation": "Correct solution: The star's prime factors are 11 (left circle) and 2, 3 (overlap). The product is \\(11 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 66\\).  \nStudent's likely calculation: Added all numbers in the star's circle and overlap: \\(11 + 2 + 3 = 16\\).  \nFlaw: The student treated prime factors as additive components rather than multiplicative ones.  \nConnection to error: This directly substitutes summation for the required prime factorization multiplication step.  \nDistinction from related errors: The intersection values were included (so not ignored), and the error wasn't caused by multiplying all diagram elements (since 5 was excluded).",
