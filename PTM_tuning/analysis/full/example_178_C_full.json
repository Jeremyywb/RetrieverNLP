  "explanation": "To compute \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of 24, the correct operation is \\( 24 \\div 6 = 4 \\). The student calculated \\( 24 \\times 6 = 144 \\), erroneously multiplying by the denominator instead of dividing. This indicates they interpreted \"of\" as requiring multiplication by the fraction's denominator alone, bypassing the division inherent in fractional parts. The error stems from conflating the role of the denominator (which specifies how many equal parts to divide by) with an instruction to multiply. This directly matches the misconception of equating \"finding a fraction of\" with multiplying by the denominator, rather than the related error of swapping division and multiplication steps for numerator/denominator (which would require a non-unit fraction to manifest).",
