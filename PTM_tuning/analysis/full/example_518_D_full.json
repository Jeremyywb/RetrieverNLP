  "explanation": "Correct calculation: For a regular octagon, each interior angle is calculated using \\(\\frac{(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ}{n} = \\frac{6 \\times 180^\\circ}{8} = 135^\\circ\\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: The student likely computed \\(360^\\circ \\div 8 = 45^\\circ\\), assuming this gives the interior angle. \n\nSpecific flaw: The student confused the formula for exterior angles (\\(360^\\circ/n\\)) with interior angles. They did not recognize that interior and exterior angles are supplementary (sum to \\(180^\\circ\\)).\n\nMisconception link: This error directly stems from misapplying the exterior angle formula (\\(360^\\circ/n\\)) as the interior angle, omitting the critical step of subtracting from \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: Unlike the listed misconception of using \\(360^\\circ - (180^\\circ/n)\\), which would yield \\(337.5^\\circ\\), the student\u2019s error reflects a confusion between exterior and interior angle relationships rather than an incorrect formula modification.",
