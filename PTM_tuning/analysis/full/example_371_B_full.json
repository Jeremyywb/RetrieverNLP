  "explanation": "To rotate point \\( A(1,3) \\) 90\u00b0 clockwise around \\( (3,2) \\):\n1. Subtract the center: \\( (1-3, 3-2) = (-2,1) \\)\n2. Apply rotation: \\( (1, 2) \\) (since \\( 90^\\circ \\) clockwise transforms \\( (x,y) \\) to \\( (y,-x) \\))\n3. Add center back: \\( (1+3, 2+2) = (4,4) \\). Correct final position should be \\( (4,4) \\), not \\( (4,3) \\).\n\nThe student assumed adding \\( (3,2) \\) directly to original coordinates (e.g., \\( (1,3) \\rightarrow (4,5) \\)), misinterpreting rotation as translation. This conflates translating by the center's vector with rotating around the center. The error stems from treating the center's coordinates as a displacement instead of a pivot point. Unlike confusion about rotation direction or angle, this specifically misapplies the geometric transformation type. The incorrect answer reflects a failure to distinguish between translation vectors and rotation centers, not merely an incorrect center choice.",
