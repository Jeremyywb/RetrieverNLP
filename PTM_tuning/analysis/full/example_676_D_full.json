  "explanation": "The correct simplification combines like terms: \\( e + e + e = 1e + 1e + 1e = (1+1+1)e = 3e \\).  \nThe student likely failed to recognize that each \\( e \\) term has an implicit coefficient of 1. This caused them to treat \\( e \\) as an indivisible unit rather than \\( 1e \\), preventing them from summing the coefficients.  \nThe error directly stems from not interpreting \\( e \\) as having a coefficient, which is required to perform addition of like terms. This aligns with the misconception that variables without explicit coefficients lack numerical values to combine.  \nThe distinction from related misconceptions is clear: the error occurs at the initial step of identifying coefficients, not during the act of addition itself or confusion between addition and multiplication.",
