  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \nRed corresponds to 3 parts: \\( 3x = 1200 \\) \u2192 \\( x = 400 \\). \nWhite (4 parts): \\( 4x = 1600 \\) ml.\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \nLikely computed \\( 4 \\times 1200 = 4800 \\), treating the entire red quantity as one ratio unit rather than 3 units.\n\nSpecific flaw: \nThe student misapplied the ratio by multiplying the given red quantity directly by 4, failing to recognize that 1200 ml represents 3 parts, not 1 part. This indicates they did not normalize the ratio by first finding the value of one part.\n\nConnection to misconception: \nThey treated the ratio as a direct multiplier (4 \u00d7 red) instead of part-to-part equivalence. This aligns with misunderstanding how ratios define proportional relationships through equal parts.\n\nDistinction from related errors: \nThis differs from part-to-whole confusion (which would involve dividing by total parts) or assuming the total is given as one part. The error stems specifically from skipping the step of calculating the unit value.\n\nFinal confirmation: \nThe mismatch between treating 1200 as 3 parts (correct) vs. 1 part (student's error) directly explains the 3\u00d7 overcalculation (1600 vs. 4800).",
