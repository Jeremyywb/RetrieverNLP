  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses complementary probability: \\(1 - \\frac{\\binom{3}{2}}{\\binom{7}{2}} = 1 - \\frac{3}{21} = \\frac{18}{21} = \\frac{36}{42}\\). \n\nThe student likely computed only the probability of selecting exactly one red ball: \\(\\frac{\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}}{\\binom{7}{2}} = \\frac{12}{21} = \\frac{24}{42}\\). \n\nThis shows they considered \"at least one red\" as equivalent to \"exactly one red,\" omitting the cases where both balls are red. The misconception stems from interpreting \"at least\" as strictly matching the minimum requirement (1 red) rather than including all higher cases (1 or 2 reds). \n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception of misinterpreting \"at least\" as only the specified number, not the broader set. It differs from related errors like adding numerators or focusing solely on the first event, as the error specifically involves incomplete case inclusion.",
