  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\) because \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\nIncorrect calculation: \\( 9 \\div 2 = 4.5 \\).\n\nThe student treated square root as equivalent to halving the number, assuming the inverse of squaring is division by 2 rather than finding the original factor. This misconception directly maps \"square\" to doubling (instead of multiplying by itself) and \"root\" to halving, bypassing the need to identify equal multiplicative components. \n\nWhile related misconceptions involve confusion with order of operations or squaring vs. doubling, this error specifically substitutes inverse operations (halving instead of root extraction) rather than misapplying division steps or misdefining squaring. The key divergence occurs at interpreting the fundamental relationship between exponents and their inverses.",
