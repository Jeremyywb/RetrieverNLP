  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The input m+2 must transform to 3m+2. Applying Tom's \"+2m\" to the input: (m+2) + 2m = 3m+2. Katie's \"\u00d73\" would yield 3(m+2) = 3m+6 \u2260 3m+2. Only Tom's function works.\n\nStudent's error: They likely treated Katie's \"\u00d73\" as multiplying only the variable term m in the input m+2, resulting in 3m +2 (instead of 3(m+2)). This assumes the function acts on m alone before adding 2, rather than operating on the full input expression.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student failed to apply the \"\u00d73\" operation to the entire input m+2. They altered the function's scope, restricting multiplication to the variable term rather than the complete quantity.\n\nMisconception link: This matches the error of \"changing the order of operations\" by not processing the input as a unified expression. The student treated \"+2\" as separate from the function's multiplicative step.\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"only multiplying numerical terms\" or misinterpreting algebraic notation. The error specifically involves misapplying the function's domain to part of the input rather than the whole.\n\nKey takeaway: The student incorrectly segmented the input m+2 into separate components to validate both functions, violating the function machine's requirement to process the entire input at once.",
