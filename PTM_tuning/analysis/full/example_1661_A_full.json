  "explanation": "The correct calculation applies the power rule: \\( (4^{6})^{2} = 4^{6 \\times 2} = 4^{12} \\).  \nThe student likely computed \\( 4^{6+2} = 4^{8} \\), treating the exponents as terms to add instead of multiply.  \nThis error stems from conflating the rule for multiplying powers with the same base (\\( a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n} \\)) with the distinct rule for a power raised to another power.  \nThe misconception caused the student to misapply addition where exponentiation rules require multiplication.  \nThis differs from related errors like multiplying exponents during multiplication (e.g., \\( 4^6 \\times 4^2 = 4^{12} \\)), as the student here incorrectly used addition rather than multiplication.  \nThe specific misapplication of additive reasoning to a power-of-power scenario directly aligns with the stated misunderstanding of index laws.",
