  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Rectangle area = 7\u00d73 = 21. Matching triangle area requires (base\u00d7height)/2 = 21. Correct answer uses (6\u00d77)/2 = 21.\n\nStudent's calculation: They likely computed (6\u00d78)/2 = 24 or incorrectly used 6\u00d78=48. Their selected triangle's dimensions (base 6, height 8) produce an area mismatch with the rectangle.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student selected a triangle with an incorrect perpendicular height (8 instead of 7). This suggests they either misidentified which numerical value represented the valid perpendicular height or confused height requirements.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error stems from using incorrect dimensions (height 8) rather than recognizing the required height (7) to match the rectangle's area. This aligns with \"uses incorrect dimensions\" rather than slant-height confusion, as the student did reference a perpendicular height value.\n\nDistinguishing factors: Unlike slant-height errors, the student attempted to use perpendicular height but chose the wrong value. This differs from \"thinks all dimensions must be used\" since their error doesn't involve the redundant slant length (13).",
