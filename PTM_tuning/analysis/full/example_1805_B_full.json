  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n1\u00b3 = 1\u00d71\u00d71 = 1 (smallest odd cube)  \nNext cubes: 2\u00b3=8 (even), 3\u00b3=27 (odd)  \n\nStudent's error:  \nCalculated 3 as the cube of 1, likely through:  \n1\u00d73 = 3  \n\nFlawed reasoning:  \nThe student treated cubing as single multiplication by 3 rather than threefold multiplication. This converts 1\u00b3 \u2192 1\u00d73 = 3 instead of 1\u00d71\u00d71 = 1. The misconception directly substitutes exponentiation with linear scaling by 3, bypassing the core definition of cube numbers.  \n\nDistinction:  \nThis differs from confusing cube numbers with primes (3 is prime but 1\u00b3 isn't) or general multiples of 3 (where 6 or 9 would also qualify). The error specifically stems from misapplying the cubing operation's mechanics.",
