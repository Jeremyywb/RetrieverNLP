  "explanation": "To move from \\((5, -2)\\) to \\((0, 1)\\):  \n- Horizontal change: \\(0 - 5 = -5\\) (left 5).  \n- Vertical change: \\(1 - (-2) = 3\\) (up 3).  \n\nThe student correctly calculated the horizontal movement as left 5 but stated \"down 1\" vertically. The error stems from misinterpreting the vertical direction when crossing the x-axis. The student likely split the vertical movement into two segments: from \\(-2\\) to \\(0\\) and \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). Mistakenly treating the first segment (\\(-2\\) to \\(0\\)) as a downward movement (incorrectly subtracting 2 instead of adding 2), they combined this with the upward 1 to \\(1\\), resulting in a net \"down 1.\" This reflects a miscount when transitioning across the x-axis, where negative-to-positive y-values were misinterpreted as requiring downward motion.  \n\nThis differs from the misconception of confusing translation direction (e.g., interpreting positive y as down), which would produce \"down 3\" instead of \"down 1.\" The error is specific to axis-crossing miscalculations rather than a systemic reversal of coordinate directions.",
