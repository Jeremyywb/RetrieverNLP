  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Triangles: Term n has n triangles. Term 3=3, Term 6=6 (double)\n- Sticks: Arithmetic sequence starting at 4 with +3 per term. Term 3=4+3(2)=10, Term 6=4+3(5)=19. 10\u00d72=20\u226019\n\nStudent's error:\nLikely calculated sticks as 3\u00d7n +1 (e.g., Term 1=4=3\u00d71+1, Term 3=10=3\u00d73+1, then incorrectly assumed Term 6=3\u00d76+1=19 would equal 2\u00d710=20)\n\nFlawed reasoning:\nThe student treated the stick sequence as linear function f(n)=3n+1 but incorrectly assumed proportionality (f(6)=2f(3)). This fails because linear functions with f(0)\u22600 (here f(0)=1) are not proportional. The error stems from applying proportional reasoning to a non-proportional linear relationship.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThe error isn't about failing to recognize linearity (they identified the +3 pattern) but about incorrectly assuming doubling terms would double outputs despite the constant term. This matches \"incorrect proportional reasoning\" rather than pattern recognition errors.",
