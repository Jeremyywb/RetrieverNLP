  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Given \\( y = 3x \\), when \\( y = 9 \\), solve \\( 9 = 3x \\) by dividing both sides by 3: \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely multiplied \\( y = 9 \\) by 3 (\\( 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\)) instead of dividing, assuming the same operation (multiplication) applies when solving for \\( x \\).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the relationship as direct multiplication in both directions, failing to apply the inverse operation (division) required to isolate \\( x \\). This reflects confusion about inverse operations when reversing a multiplicative relationship.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike errors that involve substituting values incorrectly or changing operations arbitrarily, this error specifically stems from preserving the original operation (multiplication) instead of reversing it.\n\nConclusion: The student maintained the equation's original multiplicative structure when solving for \\( x \\), directly causing the 27 result rather than applying division.",
