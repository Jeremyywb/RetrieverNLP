  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires finding a number \\( x \\) such that \\( x^3 = 27 \\). Since \\( 3^3 = 27 \\), \\( \\sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \\). \n\nThe student likely computed \\( 27 \\times 3 = 81 \\), treating the cube root operation as multiplication by 3. \n\nThis error stems from conflating \"cubing\" (raising to the 3rd power) with multiplying by 3. The student incorrectly assumed the cube root reverses this imagined operation, requiring multiplication by 3 instead of identifying the original base. \n\nThis misconception directly explains the error, as \\( 81 \\) results from \\( 27 \\times 3 \\). In contrast, mistaking cube rooting for cubing would yield \\( 27^3 \\), and raising to a higher power (e.g., \\( 3^4 \\)) would involve exponentiation steps, not simple multiplication. \n\nThe error is uniquely tied to misdefining cubing as multiplication by 3, not confusion with other exponent rules or operations.",
