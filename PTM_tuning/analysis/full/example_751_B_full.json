  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows hits as 40% (360\u00b0\u00d70.4=144\u00b0) and misses as 60% (360\u00b0\u00d70.6=216\u00b0), requiring hits to occupy just over a third of the chart. The student's answer allocated 2/3 (\u224866.7%) to hits, equivalent to 240\u00b0, and 1/3 to misses. \n\nThe student likely misapplied fraction-percentage equivalence, interpreting 40% as 2/3 instead of 2/5. This caused them to invert the ratio, assigning a 2:1 sector ratio (hits:misses) rather than the correct 2:3 ratio. The error stems from conflating denominator choices (e.g., assuming 40% \u2248 2/3 of a \"simpler\" base like 3 instead of calculating 40/100=2/5). \n\nThis directly connects to misinterpreting proportional relationships in visual models, as the student substituted an incorrect fractional equivalent without verifying the arithmetic. It differs from estimation errors because the mistake occurred at the conversion stage, not during visual approximation of drawn sectors. The error is rooted in flawed mathematical translation of percentages to pie chart sectors, not color/shading misinterpretations.",
