  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \nSum = 1 + 4 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30  \nMean = 30 \u00f7 5 = 6  \n\nStudent\u2019s error:  \nSelected the middle value (7) in the ordered list 1, 4, 7, 9, 9.  \n\nReasoning flaw:  \nThe student treated the problem as requiring identification of the central positional value (median) instead of calculating the arithmetic average. This reflects a confusion between the definitions of mean and median.  \n\nMisconception link:  \nThe error directly stems from conflating the formula for the mean (sum/count) with the method for finding the median (middle value).  \n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:  \nThe answer is not the mode (9), ruling out mode-related errors. The error specifically substitutes positional reasoning (median) for computational averaging (mean), which differs from confusing median/mode or mean/mode.",
