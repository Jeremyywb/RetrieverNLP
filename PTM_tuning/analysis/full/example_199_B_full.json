  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows \\( \\sqrt{36} = 6 \\) (rational) and \\( \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3} \\) (irrational). The student likely simplified \\( \\sqrt{12} \\) as \\( 2\\sqrt{3} \\) but incorrectly concluded it was rational. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting partial simplification as making the entire expression rational. The student recognized \\( 12 = 4 \\times 3 \\) and factored out \\( \\sqrt{4} \\), but failed to understand that \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) remains irrational. This reflects a misunderstanding of how simplification affects rationality: only perfect square factors matter, not the mere presence of an integer multiplier. \n\nThis explanation aligns with the misconception about simplifying surds (focusing on the step of factoring out squares without evaluating the remaining radical) rather than broader misunderstandings like decimal recognition or integer-surd multiplication rules. The student\u2019s reasoning diverged at the critical point of evaluating the simplified form\u2019s components.",
