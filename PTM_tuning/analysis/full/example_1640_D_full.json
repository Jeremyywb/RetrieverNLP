  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times 6 = \\frac{1 \\times 6}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1 \\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times 6 = \\frac{1}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{1}{36} \\) (misapplied step) \u2192 Final answer: 6 (unrelated to calculation).\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student incorrectly multiplied the denominator (6) by 6 instead of the numerator (1). However, their final answer (6) suggests they abandoned the denominator entirely after this error, treating \\( \\frac{1}{36} \\) as 36 and then simplifying incorrectly. This indicates a compounded error: first misapplying multiplication to the denominator, then mishandling fraction inversion or simplification.\n\nConnection to misconception: The initial error matches multiplying the denominator instead of the numerator, but the student's final answer reveals an additional failure to retain the fraction structure, conflating reciprocal operations.\n\nDistinction: Unlike multiplying both numerator/denominator (which would yield \\( \\frac{6}{36} \\)) or reciprocal errors (which apply to fraction division), this error stems specifically from misplacing the multiplication's target (denominator) and subsequent mishandling of the result.",
