  "explanation": "The correct pattern adds 2 boxes each term:  \nPosition 1: 3 boxes  \nPosition 2: 3 + 2 = 5  \nPosition 3: 5 + 2 = 7  \n\nThe student likely calculated:  \nPosition 1: 3  \nPosition 2: 3 + 1 = 4  \n\nThe error stems from assuming a constant difference of +1 between consecutive terms, ignoring the visual pattern's explicit 2-box addition per term. This directly aligns with the misconception of defaulting to sequential +1 increments without verifying the actual growth pattern. The distinction from related misconceptions is that the student focused on numerical position order (1\u21922\u21923) rather than analyzing the visual structure's additive rule. They treated the term numbers as consecutive integers rather than interpreting the geometric progression shown.",
