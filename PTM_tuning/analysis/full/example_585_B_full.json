  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nMultiply first equation by 2: 8x + 2y = 14\nSubtract second equation: (8x + 2y) - (3x + 2y) = 14 - 4 \u2192 5x = 10 \u2192 x = 2  \nSubstitute x = 2 into 4x + y = 7 \u2192 y = -1\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nLikely multiplied first equation by 2 correctly but then added equations instead of subtracting:\n8x + 2y = 14  \n3x + 2y = 4  \nAddition gives 11x + 4y = 18  \nIf combined with original first equation (4x + y = 7), substituting y = 7 - 4x into 11x + 4(7 - 4x) = 18 would still yield x = 2 (correctly). However, the student's final answer (x = 3, y = -5) suggests they abandoned the system after solving 4x + y = 7 for x = 3, failing to link it to the second equation.\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student isolated variables in the first equation without connecting to the second, as their answer satisfies only 4x + y = 7. This indicates they treated the equations separately rather than as a system.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nWhile transforming equations incorrectly could occur during elimination, the error here stems from not using both equations interdependently. The student's values work for one equation but not the system, contrasting with errors in algebraic manipulation during transformation steps.",
