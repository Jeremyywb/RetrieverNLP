  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Scale factor = Image length / Original length = 6/2 = 3 or 3/1 = 3.\n\nStudent's likely calculation: Divided Original length / Image length = 2/6 = 1/3, then incorrectly took the negative reciprocal (-3) instead of recognizing the division was inverted.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student reversed the division order (original/image) but then compounded the error by introducing a negative sign, likely misapplying the concept that negative scale factors indicate direction changes (reflections), which isn't applicable here.\n\nConnection to misconception: Dividing original by image directly causes the inverted ratio (1/3), but the student's introduction of a negative sign suggests confusion between scale factor magnitude and directional transformations, which isn't required in this enlargement.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike pure subtraction errors (which would yield positive differences) or simple division inversion (yielding 1/3), the negative sign indicates an added layer of misunderstanding about scale factor sign conventions.",
