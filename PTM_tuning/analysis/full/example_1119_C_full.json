  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n5 km \u00d7 1000 = 5000 m  \n7 cm \u00f7 100 = 0.07 m  \nTotal = 5000 + 0.07 = 5000.07 m\n\nStudent's error:  \n5000 m (correct km conversion) + 7 cm treated as 7 m \u2192 5007 m\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student converted centimeters to meters by using multiplication (7 \u00d7 1) instead of division (7 \u00f7 100). This directly stems from misapplying the unit conversion factor (1 m = 100 cm), effectively treating centimeters as equivalent to meters. \n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis isn't an addition error (they converted units first) or using 10 cm/m (which would yield 5000.70 m). The core issue is reversing the conversion direction between cm and m.",
