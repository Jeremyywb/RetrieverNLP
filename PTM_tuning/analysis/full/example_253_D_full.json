  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(46^{\\circ} + 115^{\\circ} + k = 180^{\\circ}\\)  \nStudent's reasoning: Failed to recognize that the three angles form a straight line, requiring their sum to equal \\(180^{\\circ}\\).  \n\nThe student likely assumed the diagram showed unconnected angles or required additional hidden information to establish a relationship between them. This stems from not applying the critical geometric principle that angles forming a straight line are supplementary.  \n\nThe error directly corresponds to ignoring the angle-sum property for a straight line, not miscalculating the sum (e.g., using \\(90^{\\circ}\\) or \\(100^{\\circ}\\)). The answer \"not enough information\" confirms they missed the diagram's implied geometric relationship entirely, unlike related misconceptions involving incorrect sums.",
