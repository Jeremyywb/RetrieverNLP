  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Gradient = (5-2)/(7-1) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nStudent's error: Using only the vertical change (\u0394y = 3) without dividing by the horizontal change (\u0394x = 6).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the vertical component of the triangle (\u0394y = 3) as the gradient itself, rather than computing the ratio of vertical to horizontal changes. This indicates they conflated the raw change in y with the rate of change (gradient), missing the critical division step.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly stems from misinterpreting gradient as a standalone value (\u0394y) instead of a ratio (\u0394y/\u0394x). This aligns with misunderstanding gradient as a discrete value on the graph rather than a relational measure.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike confusing gradient with line length (which would involve \u221a(\u0394x\u00b2+\u0394y\u00b2)) or multiplying \u0394y\u00d7\u0394x (yielding 18), this error isolated \u0394y as the answer, showing a specific failure to recognize the ratio requirement.",
