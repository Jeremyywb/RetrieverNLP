  "explanation": "The correct calculation combines numerators over the common denominator: \\(\\frac{2+3}{x} = \\frac{5}{x}\\).  \nThe student incorrectly calculated \\(\\frac{2 \\times 3}{x \\times x} = \\frac{6}{x^2}\\), treating both numerators and denominators as factors to multiply rather than terms to add.  \n\nThis error stems from misapplying fraction multiplication rules to an addition problem. The student likely assumed the fractions required multiplication (combining numerators and denominators via \\(\\times\\)) instead of recognizing that addition with common denominators preserves the denominator and sums numerators.  \n\nThe misconception differs from merely multiplying numerators while correctly keeping the denominator \\(x\\), as the student also squared the denominator. This confirms they conflated the operations entirely, rather than making isolated errors in handling numerators or denominators.  \n\nThe error aligns with a fundamental confusion between additive and multiplicative operations for fractions, not limited to partial misapplications like adding numerators but multiplying denominators.",
