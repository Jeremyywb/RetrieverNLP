  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Both 0 and 2 appear twice, making them equally frequent. Since no single value occurs more often than others, there is no mode.\n\nStudent's error: The student identified 2 as the mode despite equal frequencies.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student likely halted their frequency count upon encountering the second instance of 2, assuming it was uniquely the most frequent. This reflects a failure to compare all values' frequencies after identifying initial repetitions.\n\nConnection to misconception: By stopping at the first group (2) that met the repetition criterion, the student overlooked the equal frequency of 0, incorrectly concluding 2 was the sole mode.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike confusing mode with median or frequency values, the error stems from incomplete frequency comparison, not conceptual conflation or arithmetic miscalculation.\n\nFinal explanation: The student prematurely terminated their analysis after observing 2's repetition, neglecting to verify whether other values shared the same frequency.",
