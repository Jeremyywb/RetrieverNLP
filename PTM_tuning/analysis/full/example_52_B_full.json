  "explanation": "The correct calculation \\( b \\div a \\) translates to \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) where \\(b\\) is the numerator and \\(a\\) the denominator. The student wrote \\(a \\div b\\) (\\(\\frac{a}{b}\\)), reversing the positions of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This error stems from misinterpreting the division operator's directionality: the student placed the divisor \\(a\\) in the numerator and the dividend \\(b\\) in the denominator, inverting the required relationship. This directly aligns with the misconception that the division symbol denotes dividing the second term by the first, rather than the first by the second. The error is distinct from assuming division is commutative (which would require believing \\(a \\div b = b \\div a\\) universally) or general algebraic confusion, as the reversal specifically matches a flipped fraction structure.",
