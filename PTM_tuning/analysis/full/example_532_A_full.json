  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The diagonals of a rectangle must share a midpoint. Calculating midpoints between (0,3) & (2,-3) and between (4,-1) & (-2,1) both yield (1,0), confirming the correct vertex at (-2,1).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely paired (0,3) with their proposed point (0,1), creating a diagonal midpoint at (0,2). This mismatches the midpoint (3,-2) from (4,-1) & (2,-3), violating the rectangle's diagonal bisection property.\n\nFlaw in reasoning: The student preserved the x-coordinate (0) from one given vertex while modifying only the y-coordinate to 1. This shows they adjusted a single coordinate axis rather than ensuring both coordinates satisfy the midpoint constraint.\n\nConnection to misconception: Fixating on one coordinate (x=0) while adjusting the other demonstrates an inability to coordinate both axes simultaneously to maintain geometric relationships, distinct from general shape properties or distance calculation errors.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike equal-length assumptions, this error specifically stems from single-axis adjustment without verifying midpoint consistency. It directly targets coordinate interdependence in rectangle diagonals.",
