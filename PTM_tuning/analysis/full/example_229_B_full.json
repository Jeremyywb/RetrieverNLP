  "explanation": "The correct pattern adds 2 squares each term: 3 (term1) \u2192 5 (+2) \u2192 7 (+2) \u2192 9 (+2). \n\nThe student likely calculated 7 + 1 = 8, assuming the difference decreased by 1 after observing the first two terms (3 to 5). \n\nTheir error stems from incorrectly assuming the sequence's common difference changes despite consistent +2 increments in all given terms. \n\nThis aligns with confusing the pattern with an unrelated arithmetic sequence where differences arbitrarily decrease, rather than using all three terms to confirm the constant difference. \n\nIt differs from related misconceptions like using only the first two terms, as the third term (7) still follows +2, which the student ignored. \n\nThe flaw was imposing an unsupported \"decreasing difference\" rule instead of extending the verified pattern.",
