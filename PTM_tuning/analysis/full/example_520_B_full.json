  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n\\( 0.15 + 0.20 = 0.35 \\), with aligned decimal places:\n```\n  0.15\n+ 0.20\n-------\n  0.35\n```\n\nStudent's likely incorrect process:\n```\n  0.15\n+ 0.2\n-------\n  0.17\n```\nThe student added the rightmost digits (5 and 2) as hundredths, then 1 and 0 as tenths. This occurred because they aligned digits to the right instead of by place value. The tenths digit (1) was added to an implicit zero from 0.2's missing hundredths place, while the hundredths digit (5) was incorrectly combined with the tenths digit (2) from 0.2. This matches the misconception of right-aligned digit addition rather than decimal alignment. It differs from simply ignoring place value (which would yield 0.15+0.2=0.7 via 1+5+2) or failing to maintain original place values.",
