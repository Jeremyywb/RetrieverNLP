  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n\\( \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{4}{9} \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{1}{9} \\).\n\nStudent's likely steps:\n\\( \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{2 \\times 2}{3 \\times 2} = \\frac{4}{6} \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student squared the numerator correctly (2\u21924) but multiplied the denominator by 2 instead of squaring it (3\u21926 rather than 9). This converted the exponentiation into a doubling operation for the denominator.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nMistaking squaring for doubling caused the denominator miscalculation. The error specifically stems from treating exponentiation as linear scaling in one component of the fraction, not general order-of-operations failures.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis is not a left-to-right error (they did address the exponent first) nor forgetting to square both parts (they squared the numerator). The error precisely matches confusing squaring with multiplying by 2.",
