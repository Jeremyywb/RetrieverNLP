  "explanation": "To simplify \\( \\frac{45}{60} \\), divide numerator and denominator by their GCD (15):  \n\\( \\frac{45 \u00f7 15}{60 \u00f7 15} = \\frac{3}{4} \\).  \n\nThe student likely subtracted 24 from 45 and 32 from 60:  \n\\( \\frac{45 - 24}{60 - 32} = \\frac{21}{28} \\).  \n\nThe error occurred because they treated simplification as reducing numerical values through subtraction rather than division by a common factor. This violates the principle that equivalent fractions require proportional scaling of both terms.  \n\nThe misconception manifests as believing smaller numbers inherently represent simplification, regardless of equivalence. This differs from dividing by different values (where division is still used) or incomplete simplification (as \\( \\frac{21}{28}\\) could be further reduced). The core flaw is substituting subtraction for scaling operations that preserve equivalence.",
