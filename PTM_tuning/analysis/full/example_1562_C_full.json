  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires evaluating the numerator first: \\( \\frac{54 + 58}{2} = \\frac{112}{2} = 56 \\).  \nThe student likely computed \\( 54 \\div 2 = 27 \\), then added \\( 27 + 58 = 85 \\).  \n\nThe error stems from treating the division as separate from the numerator's grouping. Instead of recognizing that the entire \\( 54 + 58 \\) must be calculated first under the fraction bar, the student prematurely divided \\( 54 \\) by \\( 2 \\) before adding \\( 58 \\). This reflects a failure to prioritize the numerator as a single grouped expression, equivalent to bracketed terms.  \n\nThe misconception differs from general left-to-right processing errors because the student specifically disregarded the fraction's grouping structure, not merely the order of operations. For example, a pure left-to-right error would compute \\( 54 + 58 = 112 \\) first regardless of grouping, which would not produce \\( 85 \\). The error is uniquely tied to misinterpreting the fraction's numerator as ungrouped operations.",
