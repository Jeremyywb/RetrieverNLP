  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes that both shapes satisfy the parallelogram definition (opposite sides equal and parallel). Tom's rhombus meets this despite having equal sides and no right angles. Katie's rectangle meets this despite having right angles.\n\nThe student likely rejected both shapes by applying incorrect criteria:\n1) Thinking all sides must be unequal for a parallelogram (disregarding rhombus properties)\n2) Believing right angles disqualify a shape from being a parallelogram (confusing with trapezoid definitions)\n\nThis stems from misunderstanding the core parallelogram definition as requiring only one pair of parallel sides (when it requires two pairs) and not recognizing special cases like rhombuses and rectangles as valid parallelograms. The error aligns with not knowing rhombuses are parallelograms and misunderstanding rectangle properties, but primarily shows failure to recognize the inclusive hierarchy where specific quadrilateral types inherit parallelogram properties through their defining characteristics.\n\nThe error differs from believing rectangles require equal sides (which would make Katie's shape a square) because the student's rejection of both shapes shows broader exclusion of special cases rather than misclassifying rectangles specifically.",
