  "explanation": "The correct solution identifies the intersection point (2,2) where both lines cross. The student's answer (3,6) corresponds to the red line's y-intercept (0,6) and x-intercept (3,0), but these are not the intersection. \n\nThe student likely extracted intercepts from a single line (red) and incorrectly combined them as (3,6), treating them as solutions rather than recognizing that the intersection requires coordinates satisfying both equations. This directly stems from misusing intercepts as solutions instead of locating the shared point. \n\nWhile related misconceptions involve axis misreading, the error here specifically stems from selecting intercepts rather than the intersection, distinguishing it from axis-labeling errors. The student's reasoning conflated intercepts with the solution, bypassing the requirement for coordinates to satisfy both equations simultaneously.",
