  "explanation": "The correct calculation: \\( \\sqrt{8^2} = \\sqrt{64} = 8 \\).  \nThe student likely computed \\( 8^2 = 64 \\), then incorrectly concluded \\( \\sqrt{64} = 16 \\) by doubling 8 instead of taking the square root.  \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the inverse operation: the student treated doubling (8 \u00d7 2) as the inverse of squaring, rather than recognizing that square roots reverse squaring. This matches the misconception where doubling is incorrectly perceived as the inverse operation.  \n\nThis explanation better fits the error than \"multiplied by the root power,\" which would involve multiplying 64 by 2 (yielding 128) rather than doubling the original number. It also differs from left-to-right errors or confusion with multiplying by 4, which would not produce 16 in this context.",
