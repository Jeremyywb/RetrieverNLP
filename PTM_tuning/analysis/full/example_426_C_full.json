  "explanation": "The correct calculation is \\(4^{2} = 4 \\times 4 = 16\\).  \nThe student likely computed \\(4 + 2 = 6\\), treating the exponent as a value to be added to the base.  \n\nThe error stems from interpreting the exponent notation as an addition operation rather than repeated multiplication. Specifically, the student added the base (4) and the exponent (2) directly, bypassing the required multiplicative step.  \n\nThis aligns with the misconception that the \"2\" in \\(4^{2}\\) signifies addition of two values (4 and 2) instead of multiplying 4 by itself twice.  \n\nIt differs from related misconceptions like repeated addition (e.g., \\(4 + 4 = 8\\)) or misapplying multiplication steps (e.g., \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\)), as the error explicitly replaces exponentiation with base-exponent summation.",
