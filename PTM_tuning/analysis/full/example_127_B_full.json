  "explanation": "The line \\( x + y = 1 \\) crosses the y-axis at \\( (0,1) \\), satisfying the first set. When rewritten as \\( y = -x + 1 \\), the slope is \\( -1 \\), which is negative. The student likely concluded the gradient was positive by misinterpreting the original equation's coefficients without isolating \\( y \\). By assuming the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( x + y = 1 \\) directly represents the slope, they incorrectly associated it with a positive gradient. This matches the error pattern of confusing equation coefficients with slope values before proper rearrangement. Unlike the listed y-intercept misconceptions, the error stems specifically from mishandling slope derivation, not intercept identification. The student\u2019s flawed slope calculation led them to incorrectly place the equation in the intersection region B instead of A.",
