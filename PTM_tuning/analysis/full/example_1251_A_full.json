  "explanation": "The correct calculation combines all coefficients: \\(4x + 6x = 10x\\), then \\(10x - 3x = 7x\\).\n\nThe student computed \\(4x + 6x = 10x\\) correctly but stopped at \\(10x - 3x\\) without performing the final subtraction. \n\nThe flaw stems from treating partial simplification as sufficient, failing to recognize that \\(10x - 3x\\) requires further reduction. This matches leaving the expression unsimplified, as the student halted prematurely despite all terms being combinable. \n\nIt differs from \"incorrectly combines terms\" because the initial combination was mathematically valid. Unlike \"ignores difficult terms,\" all terms here are straightforward like terms. The error lies in incomplete execution, not computational mistakes or avoidance of specific terms.",
