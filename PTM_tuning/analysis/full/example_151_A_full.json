  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Term 3: 4 + 10 = 14\n- Term 4: 10 + 14 = 24\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n- Term 3: 10 + 6 = 16 (expected 14)\n- Term 4: 16 + 6 = 22 (expected 24)\n\nFlaw explanation: The student calculated only the first difference (10-4=6) and assumed a constant additive relationship. They failed to verify this rule against subsequent terms where 10+6\u226014. This shows they derived a rule using only two initial terms rather than analyzing the full pattern.\n\nKey distinction: While the sequence initially appears arithmetic (6 added), the changing differences (6,4,10) disprove this. The error stems from incomplete pattern recognition, not confusion between arithmetic/quadratic sequences or misunderstanding linear sequence requirements.\n\nMisconception link: The error directly matches using limited terms to establish a rule - they stopped after observing two terms rather than testing the hypothesis against Term 3 and Term 4.",
