  "explanation": "The equation \\( y = \\frac{1}{x} \\) requires calculating \\( \\frac{1}{0} \\) when \\( x = 0 \\), which is undefined due to division by zero. The student incorrectly computed \\( \\frac{1}{0} = 1 \\), treating the numerator as both the dividend and the divisor. This suggests they misapplied the structure of the function, substituting \\( x \\) into the numerator instead of keeping it fixed as 1. Specifically, they likely interpreted \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) as \\( \\frac{x}{x} \\), leading them to erroneously conclude \\( \\frac{0}{0} = 1 \\). This directly aligns with substituting terms incorrectly (mixing numerator/denominator roles) rather than assuming division-by-self equals the original number (which would involve \\( \\frac{0}{0} = 0 \\)) or symmetry misconceptions. The error stems from misaligning the input \\( x \\) with its positional role in the fraction.",
