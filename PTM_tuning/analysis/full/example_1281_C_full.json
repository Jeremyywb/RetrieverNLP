  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows \\(7 \\times 9 = (5+2) \\times 9 = 5 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 9\\), directly applying the distributive property (multiplication distributed over addition). \n\nThe student's answer (\"associativity\") suggests they interpreted the equation as involving a rearrangement of grouped factors, such as \\((5 \\times 9) \\times 2 = 5 \\times (9 \\times 2)\\). However, the problem instead splits \\(7\\) into \\(5+2\\) and multiplies each by \\(9\\), which requires recognizing addition within the multiplication operand. \n\nThe error stems from conflating the role of addition in splitting the multiplicand (distributivity) with the associative property's focus on grouping order of operations. The student misapplied the associative property to a scenario requiring decomposition via addition, failing to distinguish between rearranging grouped terms and distributing multiplication across a sum. \n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception of not recognizing that the distributive property governs splitting via addition, while related misconceptions like incorrect bracket usage or factor splitting (without addition) don't fit here.",
