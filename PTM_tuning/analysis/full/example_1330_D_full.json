  "explanation": "The correct calculation counts frequency: 1 (2 times), 4 (1), 6 (1), 7 (2). Both 1 and 7 have the highest frequency (2), making them modes. \n\nThe student likely observed that two numbers (1 and 7) shared the maximum count, then incorrectly concluded this meant \"no mode\" rather than recognizing multiple modes can coexist. \n\nThe error stems from a misunderstanding that modes must be unique. This caused them to reject the valid bimodal solution despite identifying the correct frequency counts. \n\nThis directly aligns with the primary misconception of believing datasets must have exactly one mode or none, rather than accepting multiple modes. It differs from mean/mode confusion because no arithmetic operations were performed - the student correctly counted frequencies but misinterpreted the definition's plurality requirement.",
