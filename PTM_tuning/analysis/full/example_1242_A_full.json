  "explanation": "The correct answer identifies mm\u00b2 as invalid because volume requires cubic units (e.g., cm\u00b3, mm\u00b3). The student incorrectly selected cm\u00b3, a valid volume unit, as wrong. \n\nThe student likely reasoned that volume calculations involve squaring (e.g., interpreting 8.5 as arising from area), leading them to reject cubed units. This directly stems from conflating area and volume formulas, misapplying squaring (for area) to volume. \n\nThis misconception caused the student to invalidate the correct cm\u00b3 while overlooking mm\u00b2's incompatibility with volume. Related misconceptions like confusing liters with cubic units are irrelevant here, as the error specifically hinges on misapplying exponents rather than unit recognition.",
