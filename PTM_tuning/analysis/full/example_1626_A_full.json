  "explanation": "Correct Calculation: The area of a circle is calculated using \\( \\pi r^2 \\). For radius \\( 5\\ \\mathrm{cm} \\), this gives \\( \\pi (5)^2 = 25\\pi\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\).\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation: The student computed \\( 2 \\times 5 \\times \\pi = 10\\pi\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\), using \\( 2r\\pi \\) instead of \\( \\pi r^2 \\).\n\nSpecific Flaw: The student replaced the squaring operation in the area formula (\\( r^2 \\)) with multiplication by 2 (\\( 2r \\)). This directly stems from conflating the exponentiation step with doubling the radius. \n\nMisconception Link: The error arises from interpreting \"square the radius\" as \"multiply the radius by 2\" instead of \\( 5 \\times 5 \\), leading to \\( 2 \\times 5 \\times \\pi \\) instead of \\( \\pi \\times 5 \\times 5 \\).\n\nDistinction from Related Errors: While \\( 10\\pi \\) matches the circumference formula (\\( 2\\pi r \\)), the problem explicitly asks for area, making the substitution of \\( 2r\\pi \\) (instead of \\( \\pi r^2 \\)) a distinct error in formula application rather than misinterpreting the question as asking for circumference.",
