  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{8 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{24} \\).\n\nStudent's incorrect steps:  \nNumerator: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)  \nDenominator: \\(8 + 3 = 11\\)  \nResult: \\(\\frac{2}{11}\\).\n\nThe student added both numerators and denominators instead of multiplying them. This occurs when treating multiplication as addition, combining the parts directly rather than applying fraction multiplication rules. The error aligns with adding instead of multiplying both components, distinct from errors like adding denominators while multiplying numerators (which would yield \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\)) or mixing operations asymmetrically. The specific substitution of addition for multiplication at both the numerator and denominator stages confirms this reasoning flaw.",
