  "explanation": "The correct calculation multiplies by the conversion factor between grams and milligrams:  \n30 grams \u00d7 1000 mg/g = 30,000 mg.  \n\nThe student's calculation incorrectly divided:  \n30 grams \u00f7 1000 = 0.03 mg.  \n\nThe error stems from misapplying division instead of multiplication when scaling to a smaller unit. Since milligrams are smaller than grams, the numerical value must increase, requiring multiplication by 1000. The student reversed this relationship, treating the conversion as a division problem.  \n\nThis directly aligns with the primary misconception of dividing by the conversion factor when converting units, rather than recognizing that converting to smaller units necessitates multiplication. Related misconceptions about general confusion between multiplication/division are less precise here, as the error specifically shows a systematic reversal of the required operation for unit scaling.",
