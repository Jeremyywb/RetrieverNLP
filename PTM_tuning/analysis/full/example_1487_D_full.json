  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes that both liters (L) and cubic meters (m\u00b3) are valid units for volume, with 1 m\u00b3 = 1000 L. The student likely dismissed both answers due to a belief that volume units must align numerically. \n\nIf the student erroneously assumed 1 L = 1 m\u00b3, they might have concluded that both claims are invalid because the actual conversion (1 L = 0.001 m\u00b3) contradicts this false equivalence. This misconception caused them to reject both units rather than recognizing them as distinct valid measures. \n\nThis error differs from not recognizing liters/m\u00b3 as volume units (which would involve denying their definitions) or confusing cubic units with linear ones (e.g., meters vs. cubic meters). The specific flaw stems from conflating unit validity with numerical equivalence between distinct scales.",
