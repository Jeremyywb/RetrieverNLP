  "explanation": "The correct factorization requires finding numbers multiplying to 3\u00d72=6 (2 and 3) that add to 5, then splitting the middle term:  \n3x\u00b2 +3x +2x +2 = 3x(x+1) +2(x+1) = (3x+2)(x+1).  \n\nThe student's answer (3x+2)(3x+1) expands to 9x\u00b2+9x+2. This error occurs because they incorrectly attached the 3 coefficient to both binomials.  \n\nThe student likely identified the correct pair (2 and 3) but misapplied them when forming factors. They multiplied both constants by 3x (writing (3x+2)(3x+1)) instead of distributing one 3x and one x.  \n\nThis shows they misunderstood how to allocate coefficients after splitting the middle term - specifically failing to adjust the second binomial's coefficient after factoring out 3x from the first two terms.  \n\nThis matches the primary misconception of misapplying the distributive property during grouping, not merely adding numbers for the middle term. The error occurs at the factorization stage, not the initial number selection.  \n\nDistinct from \"choosing any two numbers\" (they chose 2 and 3 correctly) or \"only dividing the first term\" (their error involves coefficient allocation, not division).",
