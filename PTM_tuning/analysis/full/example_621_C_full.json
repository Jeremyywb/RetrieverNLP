  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 09:25 + 3h = 12:25. Then 12:25 + 50m = 13:15 (1:15 PM in 24-hour time).\n\nStudent's error: They likely calculated 09:25 + 3h50m as 12:75, converted 75 minutes to 1h15m, but treated the result as 01:15 instead of 13:15. \n\nFlawed reasoning: The student recognized the total exceeded 12:00 but reset the hour count to 1 instead of continuing to 13 in 24-hour format. This shows a misunderstanding of how hours increment beyond 12 in 24-hour time.\n\nMisconception link: They conflated 12-hour cycle conventions (where 12:XX transitions to 1:XX) with 24-hour notation, causing a 12-hour shift. \n\nDistinction from related errors: This isn't subtraction (answer is later than start time) or midnight-crossing (duration is under 15 hours). The error specifically stems from misinterpreting hour progression in 24-hour format, not AM/PM labels.",
