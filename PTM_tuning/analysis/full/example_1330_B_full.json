  "explanation": "The correct mode calculation identifies both 1 and 7 as they each occur twice, the highest frequency. The student reported only 7. \n\nThe error stems from failing to recognize that multiple numbers can share the maximum frequency. The student likely counted the frequencies correctly (1:2, 7:2) but assumed only one mode exists. This caused them to omit 1, possibly prioritizing the latter occurrence (7) or misapplying uniqueness to the mode. \n\nThis aligns with a misconception that datasets have exactly one mode, distinct from listed errors like confusing mode/median or averaging modes. The student\u2019s reasoning diverged at the final step of reporting all maximum-frequency values, not during frequency counting or data ordering.",
