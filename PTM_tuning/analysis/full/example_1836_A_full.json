  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The probability of at least one red is \\(1 - \\frac{\\binom{3}{2}}{\\binom{7}{2}} = 1 - \\frac{3}{21} = \\frac{18}{21} = \\frac{36}{42}\\).\n\nStudent's calculation: They likely computed \\(\\frac{4 \\times 3}{7 \\times 6} = \\frac{12}{42}\\), treating the selection as ordered pairs and counting only one scenario (red first, yellow second).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student incorrectly limited \"at least one red\" to exactly one red in a specific order, ignoring both the reverse order (yellow first, red second) and the case where both balls are red.\n\nMisconception link: They failed to recognize that combinations require counting all valid unordered pairs. By fixating on one sequence and omitting other valid outcomes, they undercounted favorable cases.\n\nDistinction: This error aligns with \"fails to consider all possible outcomes\" rather than misapplying replacement rules or the complement principle. The student addressed only a subset of valid scenarios rather than systematically exhausting them.",
