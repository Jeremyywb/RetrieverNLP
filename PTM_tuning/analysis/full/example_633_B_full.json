  "explanation": "The correct next step involves applying square roots to both sides: \\( \\sqrt{(d+3)^2} = \\sqrt{25} \\), yielding \\( d+3 = \\pm 5 \\). \n\nThe student instead wrote \\( d+3 = 12.5 \\), which equals \\( 25 \\div 2 \\). This indicates they divided 25 by 2 rather than taking its square root. \n\nThe error stems from treating the square operation as requiring division by 2 to reverse it, instead of recognizing that squaring and square roots are inverse operations. This directly reflects a misunderstanding of how exponents and roots relate. \n\nThe misconception differs from \"divides without considering the square\" because the student specifically halved 25 (interpreting squaring as equivalent to multiplying by 2), rather than dividing the entire equation improperly. It also differs from \"mixes up squaring and halving\" because the error was not about confusing exponentiation with doubling, but rather misapplying division as the inverse of squaring. \n\nThe core flaw is the assumption that reversing a square requires halving, bypassing the need for square roots entirely.",
