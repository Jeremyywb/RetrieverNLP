  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 0.15 \\times 100 = 15\\% \\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\( 0.15 \\to 0.15\\% \\).  \nThe student failed to multiply the decimal by 100, instead directly appending the percentage symbol.  \nThis reflects a misunderstanding of percentage conversion as merely a notation change rather than a proportional scaling.  \nThe error matches the misconception of treating percentages as literal symbol substitution, not requiring numerical adjustment.  \nRelated misconceptions like multiplying by 1000 or dividing would produce values like 150% or 0.0015%, neither matching the student's answer.",
