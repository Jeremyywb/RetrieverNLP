  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(360\\degree \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 270\\degree\\)  \nStudent's calculation: \\(360\\degree \\div 4.8 = 75\\degree\\) (equivalent to treating 3/4 as 75/360)  \n\nThe student incorrectly interpreted the fraction 3/4 as a percentage of 100% rather than a proportion of 360\u00b0. This caused them to directly associate \"three-quarters\" with 75 units (like 75%) instead of calculating \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 360\\degree \\).  \n\nThe flaw stems from conflating fractional parts of a whole number (e.g., 3/4 of 100) with fractional parts of a geometric measurement (360\u00b0). The student applied a percentage-based interpretation (75%) to a context requiring multiplicative scaling of 360\u00b0.  \n\nThis differs from related misconceptions like confusing 1/4 with 3/4 (which would yield 90\u00b0) or dividing instead of multiplying, as the error specifically involves misapplying the fraction to the wrong base value.",
