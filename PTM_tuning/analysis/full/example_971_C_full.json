  "explanation": "The correct calculation involves addition: \\( 50 + 25 = 75 \\), which corresponds to increasing 50 by 25. The student, however, associated \\( 50 + 25 \\) with finding the product (which requires \\( 50 \\times 25 = 1250 \\)). \n\nThe error stems from misapplying addition to a multiplicative relationship. The student interpreted the phrase \"product of 50 and 25\" as requiring a sum, incorrectly equating the operation for multiplication with addition. This directly reflects a confusion between when to apply each operation, as they treated addition as interchangeable with multiplication. \n\nThis specific error aligns with the misconception of adding instead of multiplying, as the student substituted addition for the required multiplication. It is distinct from related misconceptions like multiplying instead of adding or conflating the results, since the error specifically involves misusing addition in a multiplicative context.",
