  "explanation": "The correct analysis recognizes \\(p-3 \\equiv -(3-p)\\) as an identity because the equivalence symbol \\(\\equiv\\) indicates it holds for all \\(p\\). The student incorrectly labeled it as an \"expression,\" failing to process the structural difference between an equation (which makes a statement about equality) and an expression (which lacks an equality/equivalence assertion). \n\nThe error stems from misclassifying the entire statement as a standalone expression rather than interpreting the equivalence relationship between two expressions. This confusion between equations and expressions caused the student to overlook the role of \\(\\equiv\\) in establishing a universal equality. \n\nThe distinction from related misconceptions is clear: the error isn't about misnaming variable-containing phrases (expression vs. term) or misinterpreting equality symbols generally, but specifically failing to recognize that the presence of \\(\\equiv\\) creates an identity equation rather than an isolated expression.",
