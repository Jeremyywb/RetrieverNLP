  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes the angle shown is 240\u00b0 (a reflex angle). The student likely measured the smaller angle between the arms (120\u00b0) instead of the reflex angle. Their error stems from not understanding that angles larger than 180\u00b0 require measuring the full rotation beyond the acute/obtuse portion. This caused them to incorrectly validate Jo's 120\u00b0 answer rather than recognizing the 240\u00b0 reflex angle. The mistake aligns with misinterpreting the angle's scale by focusing on the inner protractor arc rather than the outer, but crucially reflects unawareness that angles exceeding 180\u00b0 exist and must be measured as such. This distinguishes it from scale-reading errors (which would involve miscalculating 60\u00b0 via the wrong protractor markings) or incorrect angle-sum beliefs (which would involve subtracting from 180\u00b0 instead of 360\u00b0).",
