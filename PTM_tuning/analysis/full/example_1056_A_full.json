  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the arithmetic sequence formula:  \n67 = 11 + (n-1)\u00d74 \u2192 56 = (n-1)\u00d74 \u2192 n = 15.  \n\nThe student likely solved:  \n67 = 4n \u2192 n = 16.75.  \n\nThe error stems from omitting the starting term (11) and the adjustment for the first position in the formula. The student treated the term as directly proportional to position (term = 4n), ignoring the sequence's offset. This directly aligns with confusing term values with positional relationships.  \n\nThis differs from \"term is double the position\" (the multiplier here is 4, not 2) and \"position must be an integer\" (the non-integer result is a symptom, not the root cause). The core flaw is misapplying the sequence structure.",
