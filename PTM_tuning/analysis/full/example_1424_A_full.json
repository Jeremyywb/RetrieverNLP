  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (4 \u00d7 3) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14 \u2192 numerator becomes 14/3.  \nStudent's error: They directly combined \"4\" and \"2\" as digits 42, producing 42/3.  \nFlaw: The student treated the mixed number as a digit sequence (4 followed by 2) rather than understanding the whole number (4) must first be converted to thirds (4 \u00d7 3) before combining with the numerator.  \nConnection: This reflects a literal interpretation of the notation as adjacent digits instead of recognizing the multiplicative relationship between the whole number and denominator.  \nDistinction: Unlike adding numerator to integer (which would yield 6/3) or forgetting to add after multiplying (12/3), this error stems from misparsing the notation's structure.",
