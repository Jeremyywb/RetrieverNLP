  "explanation": "To determine parallelism, we compare slopes (coefficients of x):\n- Tom's lines: Slopes 2 and 3 \u2192 not parallel\n- Katie's lines: Slope 2 for both \u2192 parallel\n\nThe student incorrectly concluded Tom's lines are parallel. Their error likely occurred because they did not compare slopes, instead focusing on non-essential features like both lines having positive coefficients or distinct intercepts. \n\nThis directly stems from not recognizing that equal gradients are necessary for parallelism. The student's failure to identify the slope as the critical factor caused them to disregard the actual requirement (equal slopes) and invent an invalid criterion. \n\nThis explanation fits better than related misconceptions: the student didn't confuse y-intercepts with gradients (since Tom's intercepts differ) or assume same intercepts were required. The core issue was missing the slope relationship entirely.",
