  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 72,980 + 100 = 73,080 (adding 1 to the hundreds place).  \nStudent's calculation: 72,980 \u00d7 100 = 7,298,000.  \n\nThe student treated \"100 more than\" as multiplication by 100 instead of addition. They conflated the additive operation (\"more than\") with multiplicative scaling, misapplying the arithmetic operation entirely. This aligns with confusing addition and multiplication when interpreting phrases involving multiples of 10.  \n\nThe error is distinct from place-value addition mistakes (e.g., appending \"100\" as digits), as the result matches exact multiplication by 100. It also differs from column-addition errors, which would yield smaller numerical deviations (e.g., 72,980 + 100 = 73,000 if misplaced).",
