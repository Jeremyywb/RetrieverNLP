  "explanation": "To convert 0.07 to a percentage:\nCorrect calculation: \\( 0.07 \\times 100 = 7\\% \\) (decimal shifts two places right).\n\nStudent's error likely occurred as follows:\n1. They correctly multiplied by 100: \\( 0.07 \\times 100 = 7 \\).\n2. Then appended an extra zero, treating the multiplication as requiring digit expansion rather than decimal placement: \\( 7 \\rightarrow 70 \\).\n\nThe flaw stems from conflating multiplication by 100 with mechanically adding zeros to the number, rather than adjusting decimal position. This directly aligns with adding an extra zero during conversion. \n\nThis differs from place-value misunderstandings (which would involve misidentifying 0.07 as tenths instead of hundredths) or generic zero-adding errors (e.g., inserting zeros between digits). The error specifically occurs post-calculation, where the valid intermediate result (7) is erroneously modified.",
