  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( (16)^{\\frac{5}{2}} = (16^{\\frac{1}{2}})^5 = 4^5 = 1024 \\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: Likely computed \\( \\sqrt{16} = 4 \\), then multiplied by 5 to get \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\).\n\nThe student treated the fractional exponent \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\) as two separate linear operations: divide by the denominator (square root) and multiply by the numerator. This conflates exponential operations with direct scaling, misapplying the exponent's components as sequential coefficients. \n\nBy interpreting the exponent's numerator as a multiplicative factor instead of a power, the error directly stems from misrepresenting exponential notation as linear scaling. This differs from related errors like swapping root/power order (which would still yield \\( 4^5 \\)) or multiplying \\( 16 \\times \\frac{5}{2} \\) (which would yield 40, not 20).\n\nThe specific flaw is isolating the exponent's numerator as a standalone multiplier after taking the root, rather than applying it as an exponent to the rooted value.",
