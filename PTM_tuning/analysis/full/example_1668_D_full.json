  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires identifying all elements not in set P. P contains {cat, horse} (including the intersection). Therefore P' = {goat, toad}. \n\nThe student's answer {horse, goat, toad} erroneously includes \"horse\". This occurs because they treated the intersection (horse) as excluded from P, despite it being part of P. \n\nThe flaw stems from incorrectly assuming elements shared between P and Q are excluded from P. This directly aligns with a failure to recognize that set complements exclude all elements in the original set, including those in intersections. \n\nThis distinguishes from related misconceptions about \"only belonging to one set\", as the error specifically involves misclassifying shared elements rather than focusing on exclusivity. The student's reasoning conflates set membership with uniqueness across sets.",
