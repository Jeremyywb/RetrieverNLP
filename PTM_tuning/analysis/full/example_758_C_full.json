  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses corresponding angles: The 78\u00b0 angle and \\( t \\) are on the same side of the transversal and positioned equivalently relative to their respective parallel lines, making them equal (\\( t = 78^\\circ \\)).\n\nThe student likely subtracted 78\u00b0 from 180\u00b0, calculating \\( 180^\\circ - 78^\\circ = 102^\\circ \\). This assumes the angles form a linear pair or same-side interior angles summing to 180\u00b0. However, the 78\u00b0 angle is exterior to the parallel lines, while \\( t \\) is interior. The angles are corresponding, not supplementary. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the supplementary angle rule to non-adjacent angles across parallel lines, confusing same-side interior relationships with corresponding ones. This aligns with misinterpreting angle positions relative to the transversal and parallel lines, rather than miscalculating alternate angles or adjacent linear pairs. Related misconceptions like misapplying straight-line angle facts are less applicable here, as the angles are not adjacent.",
