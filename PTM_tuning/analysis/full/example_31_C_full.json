  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(450 \\div 100 = 4.5\\).  \nStudent's likely steps: \\(450 \\div 100 = 4.5\\) \u2192 rounds 4.5 to 5.  \n\nThe student correctly converted cm to m but then rounded the exact decimal result (4.5) to the nearest whole number. This shows they treated unit conversion as requiring integer answers rather than accepting decimal precision. The error stems from conflating measurement rounding (used in estimation contexts) with unit conversion (which preserves exact values unless instructed otherwise). This distinguishes it from conversion errors (e.g., dividing by 10 instead of 100) or less precise rounding (e.g., truncating 4.5 to 4). The unnecessary rounding step directly aligns with the misconception that unit changes inherently require whole-number simplification.",
