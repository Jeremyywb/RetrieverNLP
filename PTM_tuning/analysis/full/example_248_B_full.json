  "explanation": "The correct quadratic graph has a single vertex and symmetrical arms forming a U-shape, with direction reversal (from decreasing to increasing or vice versa). The student selected a graph that maintains a consistent upward trend throughout, only varying in steepness. Their reasoning likely confused monotonically increasing functions with quadratic behavior, failing to recognize that quadratic graphs must change direction at the vertex. This aligns with misidentifying a cubic graph's inflection point (where rate of increase changes but direction doesn't reverse) as equivalent to a quadratic vertex. The error stems from focusing on slope variation rather than direction reversal, distinguishing it from misconceptions about parabola orientation or reciprocal functions.",
