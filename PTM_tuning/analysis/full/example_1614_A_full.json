  "explanation": "The correct equation \\( y = 1 - 4x \\) is equivalent to \\( y = -4x + 1 \\), revealing a slope of \\(-4\\) (negative gradient) and a \\( y \\)-intercept of \\(1\\) (positive). The student\u2019s graph shows a positive gradient, implying they interpreted the slope as \\(+4\\) instead of \\(-4\\). \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the coefficient of \\( x \\): The student treated the equation as \\( y = 1 + 4x \\), ignoring the negative sign before \\( 4x \\). This indicates a failure to recognize that subtraction in \\( 1 - 4x \\) directly affects the slope\u2019s sign. \n\nThe misconception aligns with misinterpreting the equation\u2019s structure (e.g., viewing \\( 1 - 4x \\) as additive rather than subtractive), not confusion about intercepts or misclassifying downward lines as positive gradients. Related misconceptions like confusing intercept terms with slope or misjudging slope direction from graph orientation are less likely, as the \\( y \\)-intercept was correctly plotted as positive.",
