  "explanation": "Correct calculation: For each triangle, there are 3 squares. With 3 triangles total, 3 triangles \u00d7 3 squares per triangle = 9 squares.\n\nStudent's likely reasoning: They observed the repeating pattern of 3 squares followed by 1 triangle, then concluded \"3 squares per triangle\" without multiplying by the total number of triangles. They answered 3 squares for 3 triangles, maintaining a 1:1 ratio instead of scaling proportionally.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student correctly identified the unit ratio (3 squares:1 triangle) but failed to apply multiplication when scaling to multiple units. They treated the relationship as additive (3 squares total regardless of triangle count) rather than multiplicative (3 squares per triangle).\n\nConnection to misconception: This directly matches forgetting to multiply by the scale factor - they preserved the original 3 squares value rather than recognizing it should be multiplied by 3 triangles.\n\nDistinguishing factors: This isn't a ratio order error (answer would be 1/3 if inverted) or equal sharing (they correctly identified the ratio initially). The core issue is missing the proportional scaling step.",
