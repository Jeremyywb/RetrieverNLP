  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 3P = 615 \u2192 P = 615 \u00f7 3 = 205\n\nStudent's likely steps: 615 \u00d7 3 = 1845\n\nThe student treated the given sum of three sections (615) as a single unit to be multiplied by the number of labeled sections (3) rather than recognizing it as the total of those sections. This stems from misinterpreting the relationship between parts and the whole in the bar model. \n\nBy multiplying 615 by 3, the student incorrectly assumed the value shown in the bracket represented one section's quantity, requiring multiplication to find \"P.\" The error reflects a reversal of part-whole relationships, where the given total for three parts was mistakenly treated as a single part. \n\nThis distinguishes from other listed misconceptions because the student did apply division (if they had confused multiplication/division generally) or misattribute the total to all five sections (which would yield 123, not 1845).",
