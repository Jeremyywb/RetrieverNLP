  "explanation": "The correct relationship is inverse proportionality (journey time = distance/speed), producing a hyperbola in the first quadrant that approaches but never touches the axes. The student's upward-curving graph from the origin suggests they modeled time = k\u00b7speed (direct proportionality) instead. This reversal stems from confusing inverse and direct proportional relationships. The misconception manifests as assuming speed increase directly causes time increase, rather than recognizing faster speeds reduce travel time. It specifically differs from \"graphs meet axes\" errors because the origin intercept stems from misapplying direct proportion (time=0 at speed=0), not from trying to reach axes. The error isn't about misreading gradient steepness or constant rates, but fundamentally misidentifying the relationship type.",
