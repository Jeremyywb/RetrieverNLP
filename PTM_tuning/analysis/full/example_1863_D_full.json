  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 12 \\div (-4) = -3 \\), since dividing a positive by a negative yields a negative result.  \nStudent's calculation: \\( 12 \\div 4 = 3 \\), omitting the negative sign.  \nThe student correctly computed \\( 12 \\div 4 \\) but failed to apply the rule that dividing by a negative number inverts the sign of the quotient.  \nThis stems from disregarding the negative sign in the divisor (\\( -4 \\)) during the division process, treating it as a positive value.  \nThe error aligns with ignoring the sign rather than misapplying commutativity (unused here) or incorrectly combining signs (e.g., converting \\(-\\) to \\(+\\)), as the answer retains the correct magnitude.  \nOther listed misconceptions, like \"dividing a negative by a negative gives a negative,\" do not apply, as the dividend here is positive.",
