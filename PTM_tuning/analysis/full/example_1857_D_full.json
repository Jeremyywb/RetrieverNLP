  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Arrange numbers (2,2,4,7,10), identify middle value in odd-numbered list: median = 4.\n\nStudent's error: Calculated (4 + 7)/2 = 5.5, treating positions 3 and 4 as middle values requiring averaging.\n\nFlaw: The student incorrectly applied the even-numbered dataset method (averaging two central numbers) to an odd-numbered list. This stems from misidentifying which values constitute the \"middle\" in a 5-element set, leading them to combine the third and fourth terms instead of selecting the single median value.\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"midpoint of the range\" (which would yield 6) or confusing mean/median (mean is 5). The error specifically involves mishandling odd/even dataset protocols for medians.",
