  "explanation": "The gradient of a mass-time graph is calculated as (change in mass)/(change in time), which yields a rate of mass change (g/s). The student incorrectly equated the gradient value itself to the mass quantity (g) rather than the rate of mass change. \n\nThis shows a fundamental confusion between the instantaneous y-value (mass at specific times) and the slope's interpretation as a rate. The student likely focused on the graph's vertical axis label (\"mass\") without recognizing that gradients require ratio interpretation across both axes. \n\nThis differs from \"gradient = change in y\" errors, which would produce answers about mass difference rather than instantaneous mass. The error specifically demonstrates an inability to distinguish graphical position from graphical steepness, not calculation errors for slope magnitude.",
