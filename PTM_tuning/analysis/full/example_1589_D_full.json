  "explanation": "To estimate 0.482, the correct approach rounds to one decimal place:  \n0.482 \u2192 0.5 (nearest tenth).  \n\nThe student incorrectly calculated:  \n0.482 \u2192 0.48 (rounding to two decimal places).  \n\nThe error occurred because the student retained an extra decimal place instead of simplifying to a single significant figure. This reflects a failure to recognize that estimation requires reducing precision to streamline calculations. The misconception specifically involves insufficient rounding (stopping at 0.48 rather than 0.5), distinct from over-rounding errors like truncating to 0.4. The student prioritized localized precision (two decimal places) over the broader estimation goal of computational simplicity.  \n\nThis aligns with \"rounds too little when estimating\" rather than \"rounds too much,\" as the error stems from excessive retention of digits, not oversimplification.",
