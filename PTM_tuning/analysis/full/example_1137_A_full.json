  "explanation": "The correct angle ECB is formed by sides CE and BC with vertex at C. The student labeled it BCA, which connects BC to CA instead. \n\nThe student correctly identified the vertex (C) but selected CA (a diagonal) rather than CE (the actual side forming the angle with BC). This indicates they misunderstood which two sides define the angle, likely fixating on the nearest labeled points (A and B) rather than tracing the sides to their correct endpoints (E and B). \n\nThe primary misconception caused them to conflate adjacent sides with diagonals or other lines, leading to an incorrect pair of points. This differs from order-reversal errors (e.g., CEB instead of ECB) or misplacing the vertex, as the vertex was correctly identified but the sides were not.",
