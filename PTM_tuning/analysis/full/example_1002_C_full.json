  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3 \\div 20 = 0.15 \\).  \nStudent's error: Wrote \\( 3.20 \\) directly from \\( \\frac{3}{20} \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly treated the fraction as a direct decimal representation, placing the numerator before the decimal and the denominator after it. This stems from misinterpreting the fraction bar as a decimal separator rather than a division operator. By conflating the fraction's structure with decimal notation, they bypassed the required division step entirely.  \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of placing all fraction components after the decimal but differs because the student preserved the numerator's position as a whole number. It is distinct from dividing denominator by numerator (which would yield \\( 6.\\overline{6} \\)) or using only the numerator after the decimal (which would give \\( 0.3 \\)).",
