  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 1175 (Dec) + 1200 (Jan) + 500 (Feb) = 2875  \nStudent's calculation: 1175 + 1200 + 1000 = 3375  \n\nThe student incorrectly used March's value (1000) instead of February's (500). This occurred because they misidentified the x-axis position of February's data point, likely skipping or miscounting the month labels. The error stems from misaligning plotted points with their corresponding months on the x-axis, directly matching the \"wrong axes\" misconception.  \n\nThis differs from \"adding frequencies without starting at zero\" because the error isn't about cumulative totals but misreading discrete values. It also isn't a misinterpretation of graph scaling, as the y-axis values were read correctly once the wrong month was selected.",
