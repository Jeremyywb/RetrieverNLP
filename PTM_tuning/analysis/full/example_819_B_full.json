  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(6 - (-8) = 6 + 8 = 14\\).  \nIncorrect calculation: The student likely converted \\(6 - (-8)\\) to \\(-(6 + 8) = -14\\).  \n\nThe error stems from treating the negative sign in \\(-8\\) as requiring both numbers to contribute to a negative result after addition. The student correctly recognized that two negatives interact but misapplied the operation by adding absolute values and imposing a negative sign on the sum.  \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception where subtracting a negative prompts adding absolute values but erroneously assigning a negative sign to the result. It differs from subtracting absolute values (which would yield \\(-2\\)) or ignoring one negative sign (which might lead to \\(6 - 8 = -2\\)). The error specifically involves inverting the correct positive outcome through an unnecessary sign change after addition.",
