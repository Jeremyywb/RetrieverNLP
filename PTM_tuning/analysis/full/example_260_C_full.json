  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows each term decreases by 7:\n18 - 7 = 11  \n11 - 7 = 4  \n4 - 7 = -3  \n\nThe student likely identified the term-to-term difference (-7) but incorrectly concluded the next term is the rule itself (-7) rather than applying it to the last term (4). \n\nThis error stems from conflating the rule's value with the next term's value. The student recognized the pattern's difference but stopped at stating the rule instead of performing 4 - 7. \n\nThis directly aligns with the primary misconception of identifying the rule rather than computing the next term. It differs from related errors like using only two terms (all terms confirm the rule here) or miscalculating differences between pairs.",
