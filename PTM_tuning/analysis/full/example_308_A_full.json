  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n1. Factor numerator: \\( t^{2}+2t+1 = (t+1)(t+1) \\)\n2. Simplify: \\( \\frac{(t+1)(t+1)}{t+1} = t+1 \\)\n\nStudent's Incorrect Steps:\n1. Split fraction: \\( \\frac{t^{2}}{t+1} + \\frac{2t}{t+1} + \\frac{1}{t+1} \\)\n2. Divided \\( t^{2} \\) by \\( t \\) (from denominator's first term) to get \\( t \\)\n3. Divided \\( 2t \\) by \\( 1 \\) (from denominator's second term) to get \\( 2 \\)\n4. Ignored \\( \\frac{1}{t+1} \\), resulting in \\( t+2 \\)\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nThe student treated the denominator \\( t+1 \\) as separate components (\\( t \\) and \\( 1 \\)) rather than a single factor. They divided individual numerator terms by these components separately (\\( t^{2} \u00f7 t \\) and \\( 2t \u00f7 1 \\)), violating the requirement to divide all terms uniformly by the entire denominator. This matches the primary misconception of selectively applying division to parts of the numerator.\n\nDistinction from Related Errors:\nUnlike errors involving quadratic factoring (where the student might fail to recognize \\( t^{2}+2t+1 \\) as a perfect square), this error specifically stems from improper term-by-term division rather than factorization failure. The incorrect simplification path directly demonstrates split-term cancellation, not misapplied fraction combination rules.",
