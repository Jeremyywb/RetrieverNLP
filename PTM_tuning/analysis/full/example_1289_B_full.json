  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 2}{7 \\times 3} = \\frac{12}{21} = \\frac{4}{7} \\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 3}{7 \\times 2} = \\frac{18}{14} = \\frac{9}{7} \\).\n\nThe student multiplied by the reciprocal of the second fraction instead of directly multiplying numerators and denominators. This caused them to invert the second fraction's terms (using 3/2 instead of 2/3) and multiply across. This error aligns with the misconception of treating multiplication as requiring reciprocal use, distinct from adding numerators/denominators. Related errors like adding numerators or denominators would produce results like \\(\\frac{8}{10}\\) or \\(\\frac{8}{21}\\), which differ from \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\).",
