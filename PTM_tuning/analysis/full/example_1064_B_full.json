  "explanation": "The correct reasoning calculates that an egg cup (holding ~100 mL liquid) would require approximately 87 cm\u00b3 (1 cm\u00b3=1 mL). The student selected 1013 cm\u00b3, which is 1 liter - a common cereal box volume.\n\nThe error stems from misjudging scale relationships in 3D space. While the student correctly ordered the objects by size, they failed to recognize that an egg cup's linear dimensions (about 4.5cm diameter \u00d7 4cm height) produce a small volume when cubed (\u03c0r\u00b2h \u2248 3.14\u00d7(2.25)\u00b2\u00d74\u224864 cm\u00b3), needing adjustment for actual shape to reach 87 cm\u00b3. \n\nThe misconception manifests in treating the egg cup as requiring medium capacity (liter-scale) rather than small (deciliters). This differs from simple confusion between small/medium volumes because the error specifically skips the correct small category entirely, indicating scale misestimation rather than category uncertainty. The choice of 1013 cm\u00b3 instead of 4172 cm\u00b3 shows they avoided larger overestimations, narrowing to capacity misunderstanding rather than spatial reasoning failure.",
