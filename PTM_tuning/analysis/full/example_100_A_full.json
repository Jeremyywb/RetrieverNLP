  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires:\n1. Total degrees = 360\u00b0\n2. Blue sector = 90\u00b0, so non-blue = 360\u00b0 - 90\u00b0 = 270\u00b0\n3. Fraction = 270/360 = 3/4\n\nThe student likely:\n1. Correctly calculated blue's fraction: 90/360 = 1/4\n2. Stopped here instead of finding 1 - 1/4\n\nThe flaw stems from interpreting \"not blue\" as equivalent to \"blue\" rather than its complement. The student identified the blue fraction correctly but treated it as the final answer instead of subtracting from 1. This matches confusing the part being measured (blue instead of non-blue), not miscalculating angles or missing steps. It differs from related errors like misreading the chart or arithmetic mistakes - the error occurs at the interpretation stage, not calculation.",
