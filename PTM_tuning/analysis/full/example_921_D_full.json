  "explanation": "Correct calculation: When rounding 20.15349 to 3 decimal places, the third decimal digit is 3. The fourth digit (4) is less than 5, so 20.153 remains unchanged.\n\nStudent's error: They produced 20.253, altering the tenths place from 1 to 2 while keeping the third decimal digit as 3. This suggests they incorrectly modified the first decimal digit instead of focusing on the fourth digit's impact on the third.\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student changed the tenths place (first decimal) rather than applying rounding rules to the thousandths place (third decimal). This indicates a misidentification of which digit to evaluate when rounding to three decimal places.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly stems from modifying the wrong positional digit during rounding, as they treated the tenths place as the target for adjustment instead of the thousandths place. \n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike errors involving multiple rounding steps or arithmetic adjustments, this mistake specifically shows a misalignment between the rounding target (third decimal) and the altered digit (first decimal).",
