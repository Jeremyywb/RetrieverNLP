  "explanation": "Correct calculation: At 20 seconds, height = 30m. At 50 seconds (midway between 40s and 60s plot points), height = 50m + (10s \u00d7 0.5m/s) = 55m. Difference = 55m - 30m = 25m.\n\nStudent's likely calculation: Used height at 60s (60m) instead of 50s. Difference = 60m - 30m = 30m.\n\nFlaw: The student treated 50s as equivalent to the next plotted point (60s) rather than interpolating between 40s and 60s. This directly aligns with the misconception of choosing the nearest marked value instead of accurate reading between plot points.\n\nDistinction: This differs from addition misconceptions (they subtracted correctly) and scale misreading (axes were labeled in 10s increments). The error specifically stems from graph interpretation, not arithmetic or scale misunderstanding.\n\nThe misconception caused them to disregard the required linear interpolation between known data points, substituting the nearest available value instead.",
