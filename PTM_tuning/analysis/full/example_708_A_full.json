  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40\\%\\).  \nStudent's error: Likely took numerator 2 and denominator 5, placed them sequentially as \"25\" (not mathematically connected to the fraction), then added a % sign.  \nSpecific flaw: Mistook positional digit arrangement for percentage conversion rather than mathematical scaling.  \nConnection to misconception: Directly matches \"places decimal between numerator/denominator\" if interpreted as concatenating digits instead of performing division.  \nDistinction: Unlike multiplying numerator/denominator (which would yield 10%) or misapplying division steps, this error stems from treating digits as positional components rather than parts of a quotient.",
