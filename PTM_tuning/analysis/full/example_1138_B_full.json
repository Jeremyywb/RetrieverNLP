  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Factor numerator: \\(9y^3 = 3y \\cdot 3y^2\\)\n2. Factor denominator: \\(6y^2 + 3y = 3y(2y + 1)\\)\n3. Cancel \\(3y\\): \\(\\frac{3y^2}{2y + 1}\\)\n\nStudent's incorrect steps:\n1. Numerator: \\(9y^3 \\div 3 = 3y^3\\)\n2. Denominator: \\(6y^2 \\div 3 = 2y^2\\), \\(3y \\div 3 = y\\)\n3. Cancel \\(y\\) from \\(3y^3\\) and \\(2y^2\\): \\(\\frac{3y}{2 + y}\\)\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student divided the numerator and denominator by 3 first, splitting the denominator's terms unevenly (\\(6y^2 \\div 3 = 2y^2\\) but \\(3y \\div 3 = y\\)), then canceled \\(y\\) between \\(3y^3\\) and \\(2y^2\\) as if they were factors rather than terms. This violates the requirement to fully factor expressions before canceling common factors. The error stems from treating terms in a sum as separate factors, directly matching the primary misconception. Related misconceptions like \"canceling unlike variables\" or \"only dividing the first term\" don't apply here, as the error specifically involves partial cancellation without complete factorization.",
