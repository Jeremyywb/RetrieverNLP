  "explanation": "The correct median calculation requires ordering the data (already ordered here: 3,5,6,18,18) and selecting the middle value: \\( \\text{Median} = 6 \\). The student incorrectly identified 18 as the median. This error suggests they focused on the most frequent value (mode = 18) instead of applying the median definition. While the primary misconception listed (not ordering data) doesn't apply here since the data is pre-sorted, the error aligns more closely with confusing median with mode. This distinction is critical because the student's reasoning improperly prioritized frequency over positional centrality, unlike errors involving averaging middle values or miscalculating the mean.",
