  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 27 \\, \\text{cm} \\div 100 = 0.27 \\, \\text{m} \\).  \nStudent's error: \\( 27 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 100 = 2700 \\, \\text{m} \\).  \n\nThe student mistakenly multiplied by the conversion factor (100 cm/m) instead of dividing. This reflects a misunderstanding of how unit conversion scales measurements: moving to a larger unit (cm \u2192 m) should reduce the numerical value, not increase it. The error specifically stems from assuming all unit conversions require multiplication, regardless of direction.  \n\nThis flaw directly aligns with multiplying rather than dividing, not confusion about the conversion factor size (e.g., 10 cm/m would yield 2.7, not 2700). The error is purely directional, not a miscalculation of the factor itself.",
