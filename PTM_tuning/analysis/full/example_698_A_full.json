  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The probability of getting 1 on the first spinner is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), and on the second spinner \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\). The combined probability is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\nIncorrect approach: The student likely added the total outcomes of both spinners (4 + 5 = 9) instead of multiplying them (4 \u00d7 5 = 20), resulting in \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\).\n\nSpecific flaw: The error stems from treating the combined event's total possibilities as additive rather than multiplicative. This misapplication of the counting principle caused an inflated denominator (9 instead of 20).\n\nDistinction: Unlike errors involving fraction arithmetic (e.g., adding numerators), this mistake specifically occurs in determining the sample space size for independent events. The student confused the total number of outcomes across separate actions (summing) with the product rule required for sequential actions.\n\nThe misconception directly maps to including too many possibilities, as adding spinner outcomes implies overlapping or dependent events rather than distinct independent ones.",
