  "explanation": "To estimate \\( 0.0584 \\), rounding to **1 significant figure** gives:\n- First significant figure: 5 (in the hundredths place)\n- Next digit: 8 (\u22655), so \\( 0.0584 \\rightarrow 0.06 \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly calculated:\n- They treated the second significant figure (8) as the rounding point, reducing to **2 significant figures**: \\( 0.0584 \\rightarrow 0.058 \\).\n\nThe error stems from misidentifying the required precision. The student preserved two significant figures instead of one, truncating the value at the third decimal place. This aligns with the misconception of retaining excessive precision (2sf instead of 1sf). It differs from rounding to decimal places (e.g., hundredths) because the error specifically involves counting significant figures, not decimal positions. Related misconceptions like rounding to the hundredth place would yield \\( 0.06 \\), which is correct, but the student's answer confirms they prioritized retaining more significant digits than needed.",
