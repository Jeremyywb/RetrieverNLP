  "explanation": "The correct calculation determines the fraction of the whole bar represented by one green subsection: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\).  \nThe student instead computed \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\div \\frac{1}{2} \\).  \nThe error stems from interpreting the division of the green section into two parts as requiring division by 2 rather than multiplication by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).  \nThe misconception conflates the action of partitioning a quantity (which requires multiplying by the fractional part) with the operation of division.  \nThis differs from related errors like confusing fraction division methods or misidentifying the whole, as the mistake is strictly about substituting division for multiplication when scaling by a fraction.",
