  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(13^2 - 12^2 = 169 - 144 = 25\\), so missing number \\(= \\sqrt{25} = 5\\).\n\nStudent's error: Likely computed \\(13 - 12 = 1\\) instead of working with squares. \n\nThe student treated the base numbers (13 and 12) as linear terms to subtract, ignoring the squaring operation entirely. This indicates they misapplied subtraction directly to the unsquared values rather than recognizing the need to first square both numbers and then find the difference. \n\nThis aligns with confusing squaring with simple arithmetic operations (like subtraction) rather than processing the exponential values. It differs from \"mixing squaring and doubling\" because no multiplicative error occurred, and from \"squaring only the first number\" since neither value was squared in their calculation. \n\nThe error stems from fundamentally misunderstanding that the problem requires operating on squared quantities, not the original integers.",
