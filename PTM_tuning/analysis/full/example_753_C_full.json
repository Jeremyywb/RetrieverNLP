  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \nGradient = (6 - 2)/(0 - 1) = 4/-1 = -4\n\nStudent's likely error:  \nThey computed (1 - 0)/(2 - 6) = 1/-4 = -0.25 or a similar fraction, but this doesn't match their answer. Alternatively, they may have miscalculated the differences as (6 - 2) = 3 instead of 4 and (0 - 1) = -2 instead of -1, yielding 3/-2 = -1.5.\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student swapped components of the slope formula or made arithmetic errors in calculating coordinate differences. This reflects a failure to consistently apply (\u0394y/\u0394x) while accurately computing directional changes.\n\nConnection to misconception:  \nThe error shows incorrect execution of the slope formula's steps, not merely forgetting the formula or misidentifying coordinates. This distinguishes it from misconceptions about summing coordinates or ignoring \u0394x.\n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nUnlike errors that confuse \u0394y with slope or sum coordinates, this specifically involves faulty subtraction/division steps within an otherwise recognized slope framework.",
