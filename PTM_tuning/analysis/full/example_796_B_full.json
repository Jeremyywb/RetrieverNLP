  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 12 \\times 12 = 144 \\).\n\nIncorrect application: The student likely interpreted \\( 12^{2} \\) as \"write 12 followed by 2,\" resulting in 122.\n\nThe error stems from treating the exponent as a digit to append rather than an operator requiring multiplication. This conflates numerical notation (where digits represent place values) with exponential notation (where the superscript indicates repeated multiplication). \n\nThe student's answer matches appending the exponent to the base, not adding the exponent (which would yield 14) or misapplying multiplication (which could produce 24). This distinguishes it from related misconceptions about additive or multiplicative misinterpretations of exponents.\n\nThe core flaw is a literal interpretation of the exponent's position as a digit sequence rather than a mathematical operation.",
