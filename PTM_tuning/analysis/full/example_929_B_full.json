  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The quadratic \\( x^2 + 6x + 8 \\) factors into \\( (x + 2)(x + 4) \\), where \\( 2 + 4 = 6 \\) (coefficient of \\( x \\)) and \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) (constant term).\n\nStudent's error: Stating the numbers must \"add to give \\( 6x \\)\" instead of \\( 6 \\).\n\nReasoning flaw: The student treated the coefficient of \\( x \\) as a term with the variable attached when determining the required sum. They conflated the additive relationship between the constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) (which produce the coefficient \\( a + b = 6 \\)) with the full linear term \\( 6x \\).\n\nMisconception link: This stems from misinterpreting how constants in factored form contribute to the expanded quadratic. The student incorrectly associated the sum of constants directly with the term \\( 6x \\), rather than recognizing it defines the coefficient of \\( x \\).\n\nDistinction: This differs from the related misconception about multiplying constants to get the coefficient of \\( x \\), as the error occurs in the additive step, not the multiplicative one. The student preserved the correct multiplicative relationship (\\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\)) but misapplied addition.",
