  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The number line spans from -10 to 2 (12 units) with 7 dashes, creating 6 equal intervals. Each interval equals \\( \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\). Starting at -10, the middle (4th) dash is \\( -10 + (3 \\times 2) = -4 \\).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely counted 3 intervals upward from -10 but treated each dash as 1 unit: \\( -10 + 3 = -7 \\).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student assumed each dash increments by 1 instead of calculating the interval size. This caused them to misapply arithmetic progression rather than scaling the number line proportionally.\n\nDistinction: This differs from miscounting divisions (which would preserve scaling but miscount steps) or assuming fixed intervals of 2 (which would align with the correct answer here). The error directly stems from conflating dash count with unit increments.\n\nConclusion: The failure to compute the actual interval width (\\( 2 \\)) led the student to treat the number line as a simple integer sequence, producing an answer 3 units too low.",
