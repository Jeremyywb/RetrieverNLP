  "explanation": "The correct calculation converts hours to minutes using 60 minutes/hour: \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\times 60 = 5 \\).\n\nThe student likely calculated \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\times 100 = 8.\\overline{3} \\), then rounded to 8.3. \n\nThe error stems from treating the decimal fraction of an hour as a percentage of 100 minutes instead of 60. The student incorrectly assumed the base unit for minutes is 100 (like percentage calculations) rather than 60, leading to multiplication by 100 instead of 60. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of using 100 minutes/hour for decimal conversions. It differs from errors like dividing 10/12 (which would yield ~0.83) or 50/12 (~4.16), as 8.3 explicitly matches 100/12. \n\nThe error pattern uniquely matches decimal misinterpretation of time units, not confusion about total minutes in an hour.",
