  "explanation": "The correct answer \\( x > 9 \\) strictly excludes the value \\( 9 \\). The student selected \\( x \\geq 9 \\), which includes \\( 9 \\). Their error stems from incorrectly incorporating the equality condition into the inequality. The phrase \"greater than\" does not permit equality, but the student treated the threshold value \\( 9 \\) as part of the solution set. This directly aligns with a failure to distinguish when a strict inequality excludes the boundary value. The related misconception about misunderstanding \"less than\" notation does not apply here, as the error specifically involves over-inclusion of the threshold in a \"greater than\" context rather than a directional confusion.",
