  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Subtract 1 from all three parts:  \n\\(-3 - 1 < 2x + 1 - 1 < 7 - 1\\)  \nSimplifies to:  \n\\(-4 < 2x < 6\\)  \n\n2. Divide all parts by 2:  \n\\(-2 < x < 3\\)\n\nStudent's incorrect step:  \nSubtracting 1 from \\(-3\\) incorrectly as \\(-3 - 1 = -2\\) instead of \\(-4\\), leading to:  \n\\(-2 < 2x < 6\\)  \nDividing by 2 then produces:  \n\\(-1 < x < 3\\)\n\nThe student misapplied subtraction to the left term during the first step, treating \\(-3 - 1\\) as \\(-2\\) instead of \\(-4\\). This arithmetic error specifically occurred when adjusting the inequality bounds after attempting to isolate \\(2x\\). The mistake reflects an inability to correctly execute inverse operations during term manipulation, distinct from forgetting to apply operations to all terms or mishandling division. The error is localized to flawed arithmetic execution rather than a broader misunderstanding of inequality structure or operation distribution.",
