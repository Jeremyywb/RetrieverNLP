  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( p = \\frac{0.45}{0.3} = 1.5 \\)\n\nIncorrect calculation: \\( 0.45 \\times 0.3 = 0.135 \\)\n\nThe student multiplied both sides by 0.3 instead of dividing by it. When solving \\( 0.45 = 0.3p \\), they misapplied multiplication (the original operation) to isolate \\( p \\), rather than using division (the inverse operation). This directly stems from confusing inverse operations - they maintained the equation's multiplicative relationship instead of reversing it. \n\nThis differs from divisor-dividend reversal (which would yield \\( \\frac{0.3}{0.45} \\)) or division commutativity errors. The error specifically shows operation inversion failure, not miscalculation of existing division steps.",
