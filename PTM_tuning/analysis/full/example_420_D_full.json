  "explanation": "To identify the outlier, all values must be converted to decimals:  \n\\( \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \\), \\( \\frac{41}{50} = 0.82 \\), \\( \\frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \\), \\( \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \\), \\( \\frac{79}{100} = 0.79 \\). The outlier is \\( 0.35 \\), as it deviates significantly from the cluster of values near \\( 0.77\\text{-}0.82 \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly selected \\( \\frac{79}{100} \\), likely comparing denominators alone without analyzing decimal equivalents. They assumed \\( \\frac{79}{100} \\) had the largest denominator (100) and therefore must be the smallest value, disregarding the numerator's impact. This aligns with treating denominator size as the sole determinant of magnitude, a flawed reasoning distinct from confusing \"least vs. most\" (which would not target denominators) or misinterpreting decimal places (irrelevant here, as \\( 0.77 \\) also has two decimal places).",
