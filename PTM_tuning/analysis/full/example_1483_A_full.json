  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The rectangle is first split into 2 equal parts. One half is split into 2 quarters, then one quarter is split into 2 eighths. Shaded area = 1/2 \u00d7 1/2 \u00d7 1/2 = 1/8.\n\nStudent's error: The student likely counted visible divisions in the diagram rather than tracking proportional relationships. If the diagram showed 3 distinct split lines (original half, quarter, and eighth), the student might have interpreted these as 3 total parts, with 1 shaded.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated all visible segments as equal divisions of the whole, ignoring that each split only subdivides a subsection. This caused them to use the count of divisions (3 splits) as the denominator rather than multiplying denominators (2\u00d72\u00d72=8).\n\nDistinction: This differs from equivalent fraction misunderstandings, as the error stems from misinterpreting visual partitions rather than failing to convert fractions. The numerator/denominator confusion specifically maps to counting split actions instead of calculating proportional areas.\n\nThe misconception led to 1/3 by equating split operations (halving three times) with 3 total parts, rather than recognizing exponential growth in subdivisions.",
