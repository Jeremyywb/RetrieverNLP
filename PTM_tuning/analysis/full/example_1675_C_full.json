  "explanation": "The correct method uses a ruler to measure/draw the two given side lengths and a protractor to measure/draw the given angle. The student incorrectly added a compass, likely assuming geometric construction (which requires a compass for arcs/congruent lengths) is needed even when explicit measurements are provided. This shows a confusion between pure geometric construction (compass/straightedge) vs. measurement-based construction (ruler/protractor). The specific flaw was treating this as a classical SSS/SAS construction problem requiring compass arcs, rather than recognizing that pre-measured lengths and angles eliminate the need for compass use. This directly aligns with the misconception that measurement tools can't replace construction tools, distinct from simply forgetting ruler/protractor purposes or misunderstanding side markings.",
