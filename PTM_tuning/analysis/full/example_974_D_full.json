  "explanation": "The correct reflection across a diagonal mirror line requires each point (x,y) to map to (y,x) if the line is y=x, maintaining equal perpendicular distance on the opposite side. The student's answer shows a reflection where points are mirrored across the other diagonal (e.g., y=-x instead of y=x), incorrectly swapping coordinates with sign changes (e.g., mapping (x,y) to (-y,-x)). This indicates they identified the need to reflect but chose the wrong diagonal direction for the mirror line. The error stems from misinterpreting the reflection axis's orientation, directly aligning with applying reflection in the wrong direction rather than rotating or using vertical/horizontal axes. This distinguishes it from related misconceptions like axis confusion or rotation, as the error specifically distorts the reflection direction along a diagonal, not the mirror line type.",
