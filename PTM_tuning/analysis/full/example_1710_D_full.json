  "explanation": "The sequence decreases by 8 each term: 105 - 8 = 97, 97 - 8 = 89, 89 - 8 = 81.  \nThe student likely observed the first difference (-8) but questioned whether subsequent terms might follow a different rule. By requiring additional terms to confirm consistency, they failed to recognize that three terms with identical differences already establish a linear pattern. This reflects a misunderstanding of how many terms are needed to confirm a constant difference, as opposed to mistakenly using only two terms (which would still confirm the -8 difference here). The error stems from overestimating the uncertainty in pattern identification, even when sufficient data exists. Related misconceptions about using only two terms do not apply here, since all three terms confirm the rule.",
