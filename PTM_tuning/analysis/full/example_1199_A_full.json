  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(5 \\times 7 \\times 24\\) (weeks \u2192 days \u2192 hours).  \nStudent's calculation: \\(5 \\times 24\\) (weeks \u2192 hours).  \n\nThe student omitted the conversion from weeks to days, assuming a direct relationship between weeks and hours. This caused them to skip multiplying by 7 (days/week), resulting in a missing factor. Their reasoning conflated weeks with days by treating \"5 weeks\" as equivalent to \"5 days,\" bypassing the intermediate unit conversion. This aligns with failing to handle multi-step time unit conversions, as they didn't recognize the need to decompose weeks into days first. It differs from thinking there are 5 days/week, which would yield \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 24\\), not \\(5 \\times 24\\).",
