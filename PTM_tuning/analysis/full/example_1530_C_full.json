  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(4c \\times 5d = (4 \\times 5)(c \\times d) = 20cd\\).\n\nStudent's incorrect step: After multiplying coefficients \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\), they calculated \\(c \\times d = d^2\\) instead of \\(cd\\).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the multiplication of distinct variables \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) as an exponentiation operation, incorrectly squaring \\(d\\) despite no repeated multiplication of \\(d\\). \n\nMisconception link: This stems from conflating multiplication with exponentiation, assuming \\(c \\times d\\) introduces a power relationship for \\(d\\) rather than a product of distinct terms.\n\nDistinguishing from related errors: Unlike errors involving matching bases or repeated variable writing, this specifically misapplies exponent rules to unrelated variables during multiplication.\n\nConclusion: The student erroneously transformed a linear multiplication of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) into a squared term for \\(d\\), reflecting a fundamental confusion between multiplicative and exponential operations.",
