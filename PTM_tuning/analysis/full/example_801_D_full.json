  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n10 (grade 5 frequency) - 4 (grade 1 frequency) = 6\n\nStudent's error: \nUsed grade 1's frequency (4) directly as the answer without subtraction\n\nFlawed reasoning: \nThe student misinterpreted \"how many more\" as requesting the absolute count of one category rather than the comparative difference. They likely read the question as \"How many students achieved grade 1?\" instead of calculating the relationship between grades 5 and 1.\n\nMisconception link: \nThis error directly stems from confusing a single data point with a comparative operation. The student stopped at identifying the raw frequency of grade 1 (4) rather than processing the required subtraction between grades 5 and 1.\n\nDistinguishing factors: \nThis differs from subtracting instead of adding (irrelevant here) or comparing totals (not involved, as only two grades are referenced). The error specifically involves omitting the comparison step entirely.",
