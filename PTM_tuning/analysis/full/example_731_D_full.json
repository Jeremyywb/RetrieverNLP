  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes that \\(1 = 1^3\\) is a cube number. The student dismissed all options, likely because they incorrectly associated cube numbers with multiples of 3 (e.g., 3, 6, 9) rather than numbers expressible as \\(n^3\\). This misconception caused them to overlook \\(1\\), which is not a multiple of 3 but still satisfies the cube definition. The error does not stem from prime confusion (as 1 isn't prime) or exponent rules (as \\(1^3\\) is unrelated to \\(x^0\\)). The flaw specifically lies in misdefining cube numbers through divisibility by 3 rather than their cubic form.",
