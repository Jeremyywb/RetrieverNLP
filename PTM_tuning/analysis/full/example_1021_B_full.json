  "explanation": "Correct solution:\n\\(x^2 -9x =0\\)\nFactor: \\(x(x-9)=0\\)\nSolutions: \\(x=0\\) or \\(x=9\\)\n\nStudent's likely steps:\nMistook \\(x^2 -9x\\) as difference of squares:\n\\(x^2 -9x = (x-3)(x+3)\\)\nSet factors equal to zero: \\(x=3\\) or \\(x=-3\\)\nSelected Paul's \\(x=3\\) as valid.\n\nThe error stems from misapplying the difference of squares formula (\\(a^2-b^2\\)) to \\(x^2-9x\\), which requires factoring via GCF instead. This specific misidentification of factorization method led to incorrect roots \\(x=\u00b13\\) rather than \\(x=0,9\\). The flaw directly corresponds to incorrect quadratic factorization, distinct from related errors like ignoring the zero product property (which would produce no solutions) or miscalculating factor pairs (which might yield different incorrect roots). The student's answer matches the consequences of this particular factorization error.",
