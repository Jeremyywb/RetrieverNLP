  "explanation": "The correct calculation divides total cakes by number of people: \\( \\frac{12}{5} \\). \n\nThe student likely reasoned: \"There are 5 people, so each gets \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the total,\" treating the 12 cakes as a single collective unit rather than 12 individual units to distribute. \n\nThe flaw stems from applying \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) (where \\( n \\) is the number of people) directly, without recognizing that the numerator must reflect the total quantity being shared (12 cakes). This misconception ignores the relationship between the total amount and the number of shares, reducing the problem to a unit fraction regardless of the actual quantity. \n\nThis error differs from \"not accounting for all parts\" (which would involve partial division of each cake but failing to sum them) because the student entirely disregarded the 12 cakes in their fraction's numerator. \n\nThe key misstep was using the denominator to represent the number of people while leaving the numerator as 1, treating the entire scenario as a single item division rather than a multi-unit distribution.",
