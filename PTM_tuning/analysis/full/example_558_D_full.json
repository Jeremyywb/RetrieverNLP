  "explanation": "The correct simplification requires factoring the numerator: \n\\( \\frac{t^{2}+t-2}{t-1} = \\frac{(t+2)(t-1)}{t-1} = t+2 \\).\n\nThe student likely tried to cancel terms directly without factoring:\n\\( \\frac{t^{2}+t-2}{t-1} \\rightarrow \\text{No common factors visible} \\rightarrow \\text{\"Does not simplify\"} \\).\n\nThe error stems from failing to factor the quadratic numerator into \\((t+2)(t-1)\\), which would reveal the \\((t-1)\\) cancellation. The student treated the numerator as irreducible rather than breaking it into components. This directly aligns with the misconception of not completing full factorization before attempting cancellation, as opposed to other errors like improper term-by-term cancellation. The student's reasoning stopped at surface-level term inspection rather than systematic factorization.\n\nThis distinguishes from \"incorrectly cancels terms\" errors because no invalid cancellation was attempted - the critical failure was in recognizing the factorable structure.",
