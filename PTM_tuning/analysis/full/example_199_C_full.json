  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\sqrt{36} = 6 \\) (rational), \\( \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3} \\) (irrational).  \nStudent's reasoning: Treated \\( \\sqrt{36} \\) as irrational.  \n\nThe student likely assumed that all square roots produce non-integer results, failing to recognize that \\( \\sqrt{36} \\) simplifies to an integer. This stems from not understanding that perfect squares like \\( 36 \\) yield rational roots when square-rooted.  \n\nWhile the error could superficially appear related to forgetting \\( 36 \\) is a perfect square, the core flaw is the broader misconception that square roots inherently result in irrational numbers. This distinguishes it from simple memory lapses about specific squares, as the student systematically misapplied the concept to both terms despite \\( 36 \\) being a clear perfect square.",
