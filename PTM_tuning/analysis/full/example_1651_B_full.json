  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes that both shapes satisfy the parallelogram definition (opposite sides parallel). Katie's rectangle has right angles and opposite sides equal, while Tom's rhombus has equal sides and no right angles. Both are parallelograms as they fulfill the core requirement of having two pairs of parallel sides.\n\nThe student incorrectly concluded only Katie's shape qualifies. This suggests they associated \"parallelogram\" exclusively with rectangles (quadrilaterals with right angles and opposite sides equal). They likely dismissed Tom's rhombus because its lack of right angles conflicted with their mental model of what defines a parallelogram.\n\nThis error stems from conflating special cases (like rectangles) with the broader category. The student treated right angles as a necessary feature rather than an optional property of some parallelograms. This differs from related misconceptions about side equality, as the student correctly processed the rhombus' equal sides but failed to connect them to parallel side requirements.\n\nThe misconception directly caused the exclusion of non-rectangular parallelograms, despite their adherence to the fundamental parallel-side criterion. It specifically narrows the classification to rectangles rather than generalizing to all quadrilaterals with two pairs of parallel sides.",
