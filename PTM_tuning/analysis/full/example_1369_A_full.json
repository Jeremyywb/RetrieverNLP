  "explanation": "The correct probability calculation requires the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes: \\(\\frac{4}{4+3} = \\frac{4}{7}\\).  \nThe student's answer \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) suggests they divided red balls by yellow balls instead of total balls.  \nThis error stems from using the quantity of the non-favorable outcomes (yellow balls) as the denominator rather than the total number of outcomes.  \nThe misconception directly caused the student to treat the two distinct parts (red vs. yellow) as a ratio rather than relating the desired part to the whole.  \nThis differs from inverting the fraction (which would produce \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\)) or general part-whole confusion (which might involve incorrect addition of parts).  \nThe specific substitution of yellow balls for the total confirms the focus on opposing criteria rather than the complete sample space.",
