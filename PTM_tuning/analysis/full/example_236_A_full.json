  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Convert 60 mm to 6 cm, then multiply 7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 6.  \nStudent's error: Used 7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 60 with mixed units (cm and mm).  \nFlaw: The student treated the 60 mm dimension as centimeters without conversion, violating volume calculation's unit consistency requirement.  \nConnection: This shows failure to recognize that all dimensions must share the same unit before multiplication, specifically neglecting to convert millimeters to centimeters.  \nDistinction: Unlike conversion miscalculations (e.g., wrong factor), this error stems from omitting unit alignment altogether for one dimension.  \nCritical point: The student preserved the numerical value of the millimeter measurement while disregarding its unit's impact on dimensional analysis.",
