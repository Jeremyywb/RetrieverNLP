  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires finding the reciprocal of 7: pressing 7 then \\(x^{-1}\\) yields \\(7^{-1} = \\frac{1}{7}\\). The student instead computed \\(1 - 7\\), treating the fraction bar as a subtraction operator. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the mathematical meaning of the fraction notation \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\), incorrectly associating the horizontal division line with subtraction rather than division. This caused them to replace the required reciprocal operation with sequential subtraction of numerator and denominator. \n\nThe misconception directly maps to the observed error, as substituting division with subtraction is a direct operational misinterpretation. This differs from related errors like confusing reciprocal notation or reversing division order, which would involve different operational sequences (e.g., \\(7 \\div 1\\) or misusing exponent buttons).",
