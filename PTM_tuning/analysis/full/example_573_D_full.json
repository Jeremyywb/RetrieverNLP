  "explanation": "The correct approach recognizes \\( y=5 \\) as a horizontal line with slope 0. Perpendicularity requires a vertical line (undefined slope), such as \\( x=-27 \\). \n\nThe student likely calculated \\( -\\frac{1}{5} \\) as the reciprocal of 5 (misidentifying the original slope as 5 instead of 0) and concluded \\( y=-\\frac{1}{5} \\) is perpendicular. \n\nThis error stems from applying the negative reciprocal rule to the constant term (5) rather than the actual slope (0), demonstrating confusion about how to identify slopes in constant functions. \n\nThe mistake aligns with misapplying perpendicular slope rules to non-slope components, rather than simpler sign errors or parallel/perpendicular confusion. A vertical line's undefined slope requirement was overlooked entirely.",
