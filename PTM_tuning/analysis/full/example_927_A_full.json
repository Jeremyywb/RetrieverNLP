  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n(5\u00d73 + 6\u00d74 + 7\u00d712 + 8\u00d71) \u00f7 20 = (15 + 24 + 84 + 8) \u00f7 20 = 131 \u00f7 20 = 6.55 \u2248 6.6.\n\nStudent's likely error:  \nThey divided the number of categories (4 distinct spot values) by the total number of ladybirds: 4 \u00f7 20 = 0.2.\n\nFlawed reasoning:  \nThe student incorrectly treated the count of distinct numerical categories (5, 6, 7, 8) as the \"total\" to divide by, rather than summing the actual spot counts. This reflects a belief that the mean involves dividing the number of categories by the total observations, not aggregating weighted values.\n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis isn't a case of misapplying value/frequency (which would require 5/3 + 6/4 etc.) or confusing total spots with categories. The error directly stems from using the category count as the numerator instead of the sum of spots.",
