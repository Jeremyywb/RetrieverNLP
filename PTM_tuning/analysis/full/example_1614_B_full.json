  "explanation": "The correct equation \\( y = 1 - 4x \\) corresponds to a line with slope \\( m = -4 \\) (negative gradient) and \\( y \\)-intercept \\( c = 1 \\). The student's answer shows a positive gradient and negative \\( y \\)-intercept, implying they interpreted the equation as having \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( c = -4 \\). \n\nThis error arises from misidentifying the coefficient of \\( x \\) (\\( -4 \\)) as the \\( y \\)-intercept and the constant term (\\( 1 \\)) as the gradient. The student incorrectly treated the equation as \\( y = c + mx \\) (e.g., \\( y = -4x + 1 \\)) but then reversed the roles of \\( m \\) and \\( c \\), assigning \\( c \\) to the gradient and \\( m \\) to the intercept. \n\nThis specific confusion aligns with mistaking the coefficient of \\( x \\) for the intercept, not merely mislabeling intercepts as gradients or misjudging slope direction. Related misconceptions like confusing gradient with intercept position (e.g., thinking the \\( y \\)-intercept value dictates slope) do not explain this particular reversal of terms.",
