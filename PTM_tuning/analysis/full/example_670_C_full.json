  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \u00a35.00 - \u00a32.70 = \u00a32.30 (subtracting cost from amount paid).  \nStudent's calculation: \u00a35.00 + \u00a32.70 = \u00a37.70 (adding payment and cost).  \n\nThe student incorrectly treated the problem as requiring addition of the two monetary values instead of subtraction. This occurred because they misidentified the relationship between the payment and the cost, failing to recognize that \"change\" requires calculating the difference between the amount given and the item's price.  \n\nThe error directly stems from interpreting the problem as combining quantities (total payment) rather than finding a remainder. This aligns with adding values regardless of context, not merely misreading place values or stopping mid-calculation. The error is distinct from being \u00a31 off or misapplying decimal alignment, as the result matches an exact sum of the given numbers.",
