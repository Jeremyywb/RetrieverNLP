  "explanation": "The correct equation for a vertical line through \\( x=3 \\) is derived by observing that all points on the line share \\( x=3 \\), requiring no calculation. The student incorrectly wrote \\( y=3x \\), which implies a linear function with slope 3 and y-intercept 0. \n\nThe error stems from treating the vertical line as if it had a calculable slope, misapplying the slope-intercept form \\( y=mx+b \\). The student likely saw the \"3\" at the x-intercept and conflated it with the slope parameter \\( m \\), while ignoring that vertical lines cannot be expressed in slope-intercept form due to their undefined slope. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception that \\( x=a \\) implies \\( a \\) is a gradient. The student forced the line into a slope-based framework instead of recognizing the constant x-value relationship. This differs from confusing vertical/horizontal line equations (where \\( y=3 \\) would be horizontal) or misassigning \\( a \\) to \\( y=a \\), as the error specifically ties the x-value to a slope coefficient.",
