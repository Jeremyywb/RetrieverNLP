  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The 16th triangle number is 16\u00d717/2=136. The next triangle number adds 17: 17\u00d718/2=153. The difference increases by 1 each time (16\u219217).\n\nIncorrect calculation: The student likely added 120+136=256, assuming the pattern continues by summing previous terms. This treats the sequence as additive (like Fibonacci) rather than recognizing each term increments by n+1.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student incorrectly assumed the next term is the sum of the two given terms, not realizing triangle numbers grow by incrementing differences. This directly stems from applying an arithmetic sequence rule where the actual pattern requires increasing the additive step by 1 each time.\n\nDistinction: Unlike misconceptions about fixed differences or incrementing by the first term's value, this error specifically misapplies a cumulative addition pattern rather than tracking the position-dependent increment between triangle numbers.",
