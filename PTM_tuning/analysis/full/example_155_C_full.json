  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the parallel sides: \\( a = 9 \\) cm and \\( b = 10 \\) cm, with \\( h = 6 \\) cm. The student instead selected \\( 7 \\) (a non-parallel side) and \\( 6 \\) (the height). \n\nThe error stems from misidentifying the required components of the formula. The student conflated the height \\( h \\) with one of the bases \\( a \\) or \\( b \\), treating the height as if it were a base. This caused them to replace a parallel side (10 cm) with the height (6 cm) and erroneously include a non-parallel side (7 cm). \n\nThis confusion directly reflects a misunderstanding of which quantities correspond to the formula's variables. The error is distinct from confusing the formula with a parallelogram's (which uses base and height multiplicatively) or misapplying \\( h \\) to represent half the sum of bases, as the student incorrectly substituted \\( h \\) into the base positions.",
