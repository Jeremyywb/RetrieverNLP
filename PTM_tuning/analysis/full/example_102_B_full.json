  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nTotal vertical length = 15 cm\nSplit into 12 cm and 3 cm segments\nHorizontal sides must satisfy 7 cm + p = 12 cm (total horizontal length)\np = 12 - 7 = 5 cm\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\nSplit vertical length as 15 cm = 9 cm + 6 cm\nThen assumed horizontal sides satisfy 7 cm + p = 9 cm (incorrect total)\np = 9 - 7 = 2 cm \u2192 This doesn't match the student's answer\n\nAlternative flawed reasoning:\nMistook the 12 cm vertical segment as the total horizontal length\nSet up equation as 7 cm + p = 15 cm (vertical total misapplied horizontally)\np = 15 - 7 = 8 cm \u2192 Also doesn't match\n\nActual error path:\nStudent likely misidentified the horizontal reference length\nUsed 12 cm vertical length as a horizontal component\nAttempted 12 cm - 6 cm = 6 cm (reverse subtraction)\nWithout verifying geometric relationships between dimensions\n\nCritical flaw:\nSelected 12 cm vertical length as the target horizontal total\nFailed to recognize horizontal/vertical orientation mismatch\nDirectly subtracted 12 - 6 instead of 12 - 7\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nNot a case of adding random lengths (calculated 12-6 systematically)\nDifferent from assuming parallel arrows mean equality (used vertical length in horizontal context)",
