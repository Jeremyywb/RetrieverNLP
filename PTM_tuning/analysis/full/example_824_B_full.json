  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 24,993 - 4 = 24,989  \nStudent's calculation: 24,993 - 1 = 24,992  \n\nThe student subtracted 1 instead of 4 when counting backwards. This occurred because they misinterpreted the step size as requiring subtraction of 1 per \"step\" rather than understanding that \"steps of 4\" means each single step removes 4 units. This directly corresponds to the misconception of miscounting jump values.  \n\nThe error is distinct from borrowing errors (no digit manipulation required here) or direction errors (subtraction was correctly performed in the negative direction). The answer also isn't the starting number itself, ruling out sequence identification errors.",
