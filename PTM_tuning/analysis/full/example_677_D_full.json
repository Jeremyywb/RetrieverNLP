  "explanation": "Correct perimeter calculation: \\(2x + 2y\\) (summing all sides)\nStudent's calculation: \\(x \\times y\\) (multiplying dimensions)\n\nThe student treated the rectangle's dimensions as factors to multiply rather than sides to sum. They failed to recognize perimeter requires doubling and adding both length-width pairs, instead conflating the perimeter problem with an area formula. This directly stems from confusing additive vs. multiplicative relationships in geometric measurement - a core distinction between perimeter and area calculations. While related misconceptions involve incorrect multiplicative scaling (e.g., multiplying all dimensions for area), here the error specifically substitutes area's multiplication operation for perimeter's additive one, showing conceptual confusion between the two measurements rather than arithmetic errors in scaling factors.",
