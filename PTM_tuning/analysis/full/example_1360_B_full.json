  "explanation": "The correct equivalent fraction is found by simplifying \\( \\frac{9}{12} \\) to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) (dividing numerator and denominator by 3), then scaling up by multiplying both terms by 4 to get \\( \\frac{12}{16} \\). \n\nThe student likely simplified \\( \\frac{9}{12} \\) by incorrectly dividing the numerator by 3 (9 \u00f7 3 = 3) and the denominator by 4 (12 \u00f7 4 = 3), resulting in \\( \\frac{3}{3} \\), then further reducing to \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) through an undefined method. \n\nThe error stems from applying unequal divisors to the numerator and denominator (9 \u00f7 3 vs. 12 \u00f7 4), violating the requirement for equivalence. This directly reflects a failure to maintain proportional scaling when simplifying. \n\nThe misconception differs from \"not recognizing when to simplify\" because the student attempted simplification, but misapplied the mathematical rule. It also differs from general misunderstandings of equivalence, as the error specifically involves unequal division rather than confusion about scaling operations.",
