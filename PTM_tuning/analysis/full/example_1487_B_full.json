  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes both litres (\\( l \\)) and cubic metres (\\( m^3 \\)) as valid units of volume. The student's answer (\"Only Katie\") rejects litres as a valid unit, despite their common usage. \n\nThe error stems from conflating \"units derived from SI base units\" with \"exclusively valid units.\" The student likely dismissed litres because they are not an SI base unit (like \\( m^3 \\)), failing to recognize that litres are explicitly defined as \\( 1\\ l = 0.001\\ m^3 \\), making them a standard derived unit for volume. \n\nThis misconception differs from conversion errors (e.g., \\( 10\\ l = 1\\ m^3 \\)) or unit confusion (e.g., litres vs. millilitres). The student's reasoning specifically invalidated litres as a category of volume measurement, not misapplied their equivalence to other units.",
