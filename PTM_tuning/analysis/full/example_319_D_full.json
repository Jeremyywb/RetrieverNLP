  "explanation": "Correct calculation: To solve \\(0.3 \\div \\bigstar = 1.2\\), multiply both sides by \\(\\bigstar\\): \\(0.3 = 1.2 \\times \\bigstar\\). Then divide by \\(1.2\\): \\(\\bigstar = 0.3 \\div 1.2 = 0.25\\).\n\nStudent's likely error: They computed \\(1.2 - 0.3 = 0.9\\), treating subtraction as the inverse operation instead of division.\n\nReasoning flaw: The student incorrectly assumed subtraction reverses division. Since \\(0.3 \\div \\bigstar\\) increases when \\(\\bigstar\\) decreases, they subtracted \\(0.3\\) from \\(1.2\\) to \"reduce\" the result, misapplying additive reasoning to a multiplicative relationship.\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"adds instead of multiplies\" because the error specifically substitutes subtraction for division, not addition for multiplication. The misconception involves choosing an operation (subtraction) unrelated to the inverse of division (multiplication).",
