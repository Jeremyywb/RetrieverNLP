  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n- Blue (3/8) - White (1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4 of total = 30 bikes \u2192 total = 30 \u00d7 4 = 120\n\nStudent's likely steps: \n1. Noted blue-white difference = 2 sections \n2. Divided 30 by 2 \u2192 15 per section \n3. Stopped here without multiplying by total sections (8)\n\nSpecific flaw: The student correctly identified section values (15/section) but failed to combine all sections for the total. This matches \"does not complete all calculations\" as they halted after finding unit value. \n\nDistinction: This isn't misreading the chart (they handled sections correctly) or confusing sections/amounts (they converted 30 bikes to 15/section properly). The error occurred solely in the final aggregation step.",
