  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Read depth values at 2 minutes (e.g., 8cm) and 4 minutes (e.g., 14cm), compute difference: 14cm - 8cm = 6cm.\n\nStudent's calculation: Derived correct numerical value (6) but omitted units.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student performed the subtraction correctly but failed to recognize that graph-derived measurements require explicit unit labels. This indicates a disconnect between numerical results and their real-world measurement context.\n\nMisconception link: The error directly stems from treating the answer as a unitless quantity rather than a physical measurement, despite the graph's axis labels specifying centimeters.\n\nDistinction from others: The correct numerical value rules out data misreading or misunderstanding \"difference,\" while the absence (not incorrectness) of units specifically aligns with unit-handling errors rather than graph interpretation failures.",
