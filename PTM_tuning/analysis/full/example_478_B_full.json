  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n4296 \u2192 Check ones digit (6 \u22655) \u2192 Round up tens digit (9+1=10) \u2192 Carry over to hundreds (2+1=3) \u2192 Result: 4300\n\nStudent's error:\n4296 \u2192 Add 14 to reach 4310 (4296 + 14 = 4310)\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student added both the difference to reach the next ten (4) and an extra 10, totaling 14, instead of only adding the required 4 to round to 4300. This occurred because they treated rounding as a direct addition of 10 (the rounding increment) rather than adjusting only the necessary digits. The overcompensation reflects a misunderstanding of place value adjustments during rounding, where the student conflated the rounding mechanism with linear addition.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThis differs from \"rounds to the wrong degree\" (which would involve changing higher digits unnecessarily) or \"adds the degree of accuracy\" (which would strictly add 10 to 4296). The error specifically stems from incorrectly combining two separate adjustments rather than executing a single place-value operation.",
