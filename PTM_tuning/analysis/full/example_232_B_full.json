  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows 3 divides both coefficients:  \n6x = 3\u00d72x  \n9y = 3\u00d73y \u2192 3 is common.  \nFor x to be common, it must divide 9y, but y has no x term.  \n\nThe student likely reasoned:  \n\"x is in 6x, so it's a factor of 6x.  \nSince factors can be variables, x must also divide 9y.\"  \n\nThe flaw: Assuming a variable present in one term automatically becomes a common factor, without verifying divisibility in both expressions.  \nThis stems from conflating the presence of a variable in a term with its universal divisibility.  \n\nDistinguishing from related errors:  \nThe mistake isn't about numeric-only factors (as x is considered), but about failing to require factors to divide both terms.",
