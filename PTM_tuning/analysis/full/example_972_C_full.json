  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The output is the square root of the input, so input = (16)\u00b2 = 256.\n\nStudent's error: The student computed \u221a16 = 4, assuming this gives the input. \n\nThe flaw: The student applied the original operation (square root) to the output again, rather than reversing it. To undo the square root operation, one must square the output. Instead, the student treated the output as the result of the same operation (square root) applied to the input, leading them to repeat the operation. \n\nThis matches the misconception of failing to use the inverse operation when solving for an unknown input. The error is distinct from confusing squaring with square rooting: the student recognized the operation was square root but misapplied it during inversion rather than misidentifying the operation itself.",
