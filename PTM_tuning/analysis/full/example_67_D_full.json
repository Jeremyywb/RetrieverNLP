  "explanation": "The correct calculation is finding a number that when squared equals 9: \\( \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\) because \\( 3^2 = 9 \\). \n\nThe student likely computed \\( 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\), treating the square root symbol (with index 2) as a multiplier rather than an operation requiring an inverse relationship. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the square root's notation as an instruction to multiply the radicand by its index (2) instead of determining the number that produces the radicand when squared. This directly maps to the misconception of conflating the index with a multiplicative factor. \n\nThis differs from confusing squaring with square roots (which would yield \\( 9^2 = 81 \\)) or adding the number to itself (\\( 9 + 9 = 18 \\)), as no addition or exponentiation steps are present in the student's erroneous calculation.",
