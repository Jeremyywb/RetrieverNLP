  "explanation": "A regular polygon requires both equal side lengths and equal angles. The square satisfies this with four congruent sides and four 90\u00b0 angles. The student incorrectly selected the rhombus, which has four equal sides but angles that are not necessarily equal (opposite angles equal, adjacent angles supplementary but not always congruent). \n\nThe error stems from only considering equal side lengths while neglecting the requirement for equal angles. This shows a misunderstanding that regularity demands both sides and angles to be congruent, not just one property. The misconception specifically relates to conflating \"equilateral\" (equal sides) with \"regular\" (both equal sides and angles), rather than confusing parallel properties or general polygon characteristics. Other listed misconceptions (parallel properties, general confusion) are less precise since the key missing element was angle equality.",
