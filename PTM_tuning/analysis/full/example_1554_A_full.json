  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n5 L \u00d7 1000 cm\u00b3/L = 5000 cm\u00b3  \n(Using the conversion factor where 1 liter = 1000 cubic centimeters)\n\nStudent's error:  \n5 L = 5 cm\u00b3 (no conversion factor applied)\n\nFlawed reasoning:  \nThe student treated liters and cubic centimeters as equivalent 1:1, skipping the required multiplication by 1000. This indicates they didn\u2019t recognize the proportional relationship between the units. \n\nMisconception link:  \nThe error directly stems from misunderstanding the conversion ratio between liters and cm\u00b3. Unlike dividing (which would produce 0.005) or misapplying linear vs. cubic units (which would involve errors with exponents), the student\u2019s 1:1 substitution shows they lacked knowledge of the specific 1000:1 conversion factor for volume.\n\nDistinction:  \nThis differs from \"divides when converting to a smaller unit\" (which alters the value directionally) or \"doesn\u2019t know volume units are cubed\" (which affects dimensional analysis). The core issue here is a missing conversion step, not an operational or structural misunderstanding of units.",
