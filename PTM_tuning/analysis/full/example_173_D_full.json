  "explanation": "The correct calculation divides both ratio terms by 3:  \n\\( 3 \\div 3 : 2 \\div 3 = 1 : \\frac{2}{3} \\).  \n\nThe student likely divided the first term by 3 (to get 1) but incorrectly multiplied the second term by 3 instead of dividing:  \n\\( 3 \\div 3 : 2 \\times 3 = 1 : 6 \\).  \n\nThe error stems from treating the ratio terms with inverse operations (dividing one term, multiplying the other) rather than applying the same scaling factor to preserve proportionality. This reflects a failure to recognize that equivalent ratios require both terms to be scaled by the same divisor.  \n\nThe misconception aligns with misunderstanding that in \\( 1:n \\), the second term must maintain the original proportional relationship to the first term. This differs from \"not simplifying\" errors (which preserve proportionality but stop short) or confusion about total parts (which would affect additive interpretations). The direct multiplicative inversion here uniquely matches the primary misconception.",
