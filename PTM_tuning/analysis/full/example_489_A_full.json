  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\sqrt{64} = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\( 64 \\div 2 = 32 \\, \\text{cm} \\).  \n\nThe student treated the inverse of squaring (square root) as division by 2 instead of applying the correct inverse operation. This occurred because they conflated squaring (a second-power operation) with doubling (a linear operation). When reversing the area calculation, they incorrectly believed \"undoing\" a square requires halving, rather than taking the root. This matches the primary misconception of confusing squaring with multiplying by 2, as their error directly substitutes a linear inverse (halving) for a quadratic inverse (rooting). It differs from general halving errors because the substitution specifically stems from misdefining the squaring operation itself.",
