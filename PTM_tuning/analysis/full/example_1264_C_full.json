  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \u00a32.79 \u00d74 (sum of Sara's \u00a32.79 and Rhys's \u00a32.79\u00d73).\n\nStudent's incorrect reasoning: \u00a32.80\u00d74 - \u00a30.04.\n\nThe student rounded \u00a32.79 to \u00a32.80, multiplied by 4 (Sara + 3\u00d7Rhys), then subtracted \u00a30.04 to adjust for the initial rounding. This actually works because \u00a32.80\u00d74 - \u00a30.04 = (\u00a32.79 + \u00a30.01)\u00d74 - \u00a30.04 = \u00a32.79\u00d74, making it equivalent to the correct total. \n\nThe flaw stems from not recognizing that their adjusted calculation preserves equivalence to the original problem. They treated their method as invalid (choosing it as the \"wrong calculation\") rather than seeing it as a valid distributive property application. This directly aligns with the misconception about mathematical equivalence of methods. \n\nIt differs from \"applying distributive property incorrectly,\" as their arithmetic was correct. The error was conceptual, not computational \u2014 they failed to see their method as equivalent, not misapplying the property itself.",
