  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( (5^4)^3 = 5^{4 \\times 3} = 5^{12} \\).\n\nIncorrect calculation: \\( (5^4)^3 = 5^{4+3} = 5^7 \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly added exponents (4+3) instead of multiplying them (4\u00d73). This indicates a misapplication of the exponent rule for powers raised to powers, where the correct operation requires multiplying exponents. The error stems from confusing this rule with the distinct (but similar-sounding) rule for multiplying like bases (\\(5^4 \\times 5^3 = 5^{4+3}\\)), leading to improper addition. \n\nThis differs from other listed misconceptions because the student correctly recognized exponents but misapplied the operation between them. They didn't confuse exponentiation with repeated addition or alter the base number itself.",
