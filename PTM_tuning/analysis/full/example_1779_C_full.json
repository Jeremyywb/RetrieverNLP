  "explanation": "The correct calculation counts all vertices in the cuboid's 3D structure: 4 on the front face and 4 on the back face (8 total).  \nThe student likely counted only the 4 visible vertices from the 2D diagram's front face, ignoring the hidden back vertices.  \nTheir reasoning flaw stems from treating the diagram as a flat representation rather than a 3D object, failing to account for vertices obscured by perspective.  \nThis directly aligns with counting only visible elements, as opposed to confusing edges/faces (which would affect counts of those features, not vertices).  \nThe error is distinct from cube/cuboid confusion, as both shapes have 8 vertices.  \nThe core issue is the inability to mentally reconstruct the full 3D object from its 2D projection.",
