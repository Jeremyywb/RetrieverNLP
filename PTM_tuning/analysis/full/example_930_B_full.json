  "explanation": "The correct sample space lists distinct outcomes: \\( S = \\{1, 2\\} \\). The spinner has two unique possible results, even though they occur with different frequencies. \n\nThe student likely counted physical sections (2 \u00d7 1 and 3 \u00d7 2) as individual outcomes, producing \\( S = \\{1,1,2,2,2\\} \\). This misattributes the spinner's _structural repetition_ of numbers (which affects probability weights) to the _definition of sample space_ (which requires unique elements). \n\nThe error stems from conflating outcome representation with outcome probability. The student treated repeated numbers in the spinner's layout as separate outcomes rather than recognizing they simply modify the probability of selecting the unique outcomes 1 and 2. \n\nThis directly matches the primary misconception: confusing sample space elements (which are distinct) with probability-influencing factors (like frequency). It differs from related misconceptions about combined events or equal chance assumptions, as the error specifically concerns misrepresenting outcome uniqueness rather than miscalculating probabilities or assuming uniform likelihood.",
