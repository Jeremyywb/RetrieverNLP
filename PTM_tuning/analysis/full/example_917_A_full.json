  "explanation": "The correct first step is squaring both sides: \\( t^2 = u + 9 \\), isolating the radical first.  \nThe student accepted Tom's incorrect step \\( t = \\sqrt{u} + 3 \\), which splits \\( \\sqrt{u+9} \\) into \\( \\sqrt{u} + \\sqrt{9} \\).  \n\nThis error stems from treating the square root operation as distributive over addition, falsely assuming \\( \\sqrt{a + b} = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} \\).  \nThe misconception directly caused the student to invalidly separate the terms under the radical into individual roots rather than recognizing \\( u+9 \\) as a single quantity under the radical.  \n\nThis differs from related errors like misapplying inverse operations (e.g., subtracting 9 before squaring), as the flaw lies specifically in misinterpreting the scope of the square root symbol rather than the sequence of solving steps.",
