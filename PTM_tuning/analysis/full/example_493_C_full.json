  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n\\( \\frac{2}{7} \\times \\frac{7}{2} = 1 \\)  \nThe reciprocal is required to achieve a product of 1.\n\nStudent's error:  \nAssuming \\( \\frac{2}{7} \\times \\frac{2}{7} = 1 \\), selecting the same fraction instead of its inverse.\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student incorrectly treated the original fraction as both the multiplier and its reciprocal. They failed to recognize that solving \\( a \\times x = 1 \\) requires \\( x = \\frac{1}{a} \\), not \\( x = a \\).\n\nConnection to misconception:  \nThis stems from misunderstanding inversion in multiplicative relationships. The error shows no attempt to reverse the operation, instead repeating the given value.\n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nUnlike division avoidance or confusion with the identity element, this error specifically misapplies the reciprocal concept by retaining the original fraction.\n\nFinal diagnosis:  \nThe student conflated the multiplier with the solution needed to nullify its effect, bypassing inversion entirely.",
