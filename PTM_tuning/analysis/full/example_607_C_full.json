  "explanation": "The correct calculation for 40% is multiplying by 40/100 (equivalent to dividing by 5 and multiplying by 2). Katie's method divides by 5 (yielding 20%) then multiplies by 2 to reach 40%. Tom's method divides by 100 (1%) then multiplies by 4, resulting in 4%, not 40%.\n\nThe student incorrectly equated Tom's \"divide by 100 \u00d7 4\" with 40%, failing to recognize that this sequence calculates 4% (4/100) instead of 40% (40/100). This stems from a misunderstanding of how multiplicative operations combine to form percentage equivalents. They treated division and multiplication as interchangeable steps without verifying the final proportion, unlike Katie's method where division and multiplication directly correspond to 40% as 2/5.\n\nThis error specifically involves misapplying percentage scaling through separate operations, rather than general percentage misconceptions like confusing 100/10 divisions or not grasping percentages as fractions of 100. The student focused on procedural steps (\"divide then multiply\") without checking whether the combined effect produced the correct percentage.",
