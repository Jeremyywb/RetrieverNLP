  "explanation": "To convert \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) to a decimal, one must divide 3 by 5:  \n\\( 3 \\div 5 = 0.6 \\).  \nThe student incorrectly wrote \\( 0.35 \\), suggesting they mapped the numerator (3) to the tenths place and the denominator (5) to the hundredths place:  \n\\( 0.3 \\) (from numerator) + \\( 0.05 \\) (from denominator) = \\( 0.35 \\).  \n\nThis error stems from treating the fraction's components as direct positional values in the decimal system, rather than performing division. The student misapplied place-value logic to both numerator and denominator independently, combining them additively.  \n\nThis matches the misconception of writing the numerator followed by the denominator as decimal digits, distinct from errors like using only the numerator (\\( 0.3 \\)) or misinterpreting the fraction as a percentage (\\( 35\\% \\)).",
