  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the trapezium area formula: average speed \u00d7 time = ((8+15)/2) \u00d7 (8-6) = 11.5 \u00d7 2 = 23 m (rounded to 24 m). \n\nThe student likely multiplied the final speed (15 m/s) by the total time (2 s): 15 \u00d7 2 = 30 m. \n\nThis error stems from assuming distance equals final speed multiplied by time, ignoring the changing velocity. The student treated the motion as constant speed at the maximum value rather than calculating the average speed over the interval. \n\nThis directly aligns with the \"Always reads the maximum value\" misconception, not the area-under-the-graph confusion. If the student had misapplied the line length or trapezium formula, the result would differ significantly (e.g., ~7.28 m for line length or 23 m for trapezium).",
