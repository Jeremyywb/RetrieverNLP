  "explanation": "Correct calculation: After 231 \u00f7 4 = 57 with remainder 3, the exact decimal remainder is 3 \u00f7 4 = 0.75.\n\nStudent's error: The student calculated 3 \u00f7 4 \u2248 0.34 through flawed division steps. When converting the remainder to a decimal, they likely:\n1. Incorrectly divided 4 into 30 as 3 times (writing 0.3) instead of 7 times (0.7)\n2. Subtracted 3\u00d74=12 from 30, getting 18 instead of 28\n3. Then divided 4 into 18 as 4 times (0.04), summing to 0.34\n\nThis shows the student misapplied the division algorithm during decimal conversion, specifically miscalculating how many times 4 fits into intermediate remainders. The error stems from incorrect digit-by-digit division execution, not from inverting numerator/denominator or misunderstanding remainder representation. Related misconceptions like dividing 4\u00f73 (1.33) or 3\u00f7231 (\u22480.01) don't match the 0.34 result, confirming the flaw lies in faulty division mechanics.",
