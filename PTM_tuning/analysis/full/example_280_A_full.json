  "explanation": "The correct answer requires recognizing sides that remain equidistant and never intersect (parallel). The student incorrectly identified them as perpendicular. The error stems from conflating directionality with angular relationships. The student likely recognized the sides' orientation but misapplied the term \"perpendicular\" to describe opposing alignment rather than requiring a 90\u00b0 intersection. This directly aligns with swapping the definitions of parallel and perpendicular, as opposed to not knowing the terms entirely. Related misconceptions like misunderstanding angles are less likely, as the error hinges on term reversal rather than angle measurement.",
