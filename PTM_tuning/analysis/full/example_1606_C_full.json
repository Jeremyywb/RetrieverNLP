  "explanation": "The expression \\( (2n -13)^3 \\) is negative when \\( 2n -13 < 0 \\), i.e., for \\( n \\leq 6 \\), and positive otherwise. The student incorrectly concluded it is never negative. \n\nTheir reasoning likely assumed that cubing any real number (even a negative one) produces a positive result. This aligns with the misconception that all powers yield positive values, ignoring parity of exponents. \n\nFor example, if \\( n = 1 \\), \\( (2(1) -13)^3 = (-11)^3 = -1331 \\), which is negative. The student\u2019s error stems from treating exponentiation as universally sign-flipping, conflating even and odd exponents. \n\nThis explanation directly links to the power-sign misconception, distinguishing it from multiplicative sign rules (e.g., \"two negatives make a positive\"), which don\u2019t apply to exponents here.",
