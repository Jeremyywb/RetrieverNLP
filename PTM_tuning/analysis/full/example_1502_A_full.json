  "explanation": "The correct calculation involves reading the vertical (y-axis) value corresponding to Friday on the horizontal (x-axis). For example, if the graph shows Friday's data point at \\((x=5, y=15)\\), the correct answer is \\(15\\,\\text{kg}\\). \n\nThe student likely located Friday on the x-axis and incorrectly reported its positional index (e.g., Friday as the 3rd plotted day) or misread the x-axis coordinate as the y-value. This indicates they treated the independent variable (day) as the dependent variable (kg). \n\nThe error stems from misidentifying which axis represents the quantity being measured. The student extracted positional information (day order) instead of reading the corresponding kg value from the vertical axis. This aligns with confusing dependent/independent variables, not scale misinterpretation (e.g., assuming grid dashes = 1 kg) or counting grid units. \n\nIf the graph's x-axis labeled days numerically (e.g., Day 1, Day 2...), the student might have interpreted \"Day 3\" as \\(3\\,\\text{kg}\\) directly, ignoring the y-axis entirely. This specific axis reversal explains the \\(3\\,\\text{kg}\\) answer better than other scale-related errors.",
