  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 6\\,\\text{cm} \\times 3\\,\\text{cm} \\) (area of the top face using its given dimensions).  \nIncorrect calculation: \\( 6\\,\\text{cm} \\times 4\\,\\text{cm} \\).  \n\nThe student likely associated the height of the cuboid (4\u2009cm) with the vertical edge of face \\( Q \\), misinterpreting how 3D dimensions map to 2D faces. They selected the cuboid's height (4\u2009cm) instead of the actual shorter edge (3\u2009cm) of the top face. This stems from conflating the cuboid's vertical dimension with a side length of the horizontal face.  \n\nThe error aligns with misinterpreting 3D dimensions: the student treated the cuboid's height as part of the top face's sides rather than recognizing the top face uses only length and width (6\u2009cm and 3\u2009cm).  \n\nThis is distinct from mixing width/height (which would imply swapping 3\u2009cm and 4\u2009cm in isolation) or misapplying rectangle properties (the student correctly multiplied sides but chose incorrect ones).",
