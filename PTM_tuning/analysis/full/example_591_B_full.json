  "explanation": "The correct area calculation for face Q uses the dimensions explicitly stated for that face: 6 cm (length) \u00d7 3 cm (width). \n\nThe student incorrectly calculated 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm, replacing the 6 cm length with the cuboid's height (4 cm). \n\nThis indicates they conflated the cuboid's vertical height with the horizontal length of the top face, likely misinterpreting the diagram's 3D orientation. \n\nThe misconception stems from misattributing the height dimension to the top face's edge, rather than recognizing that face Q's dimensions are independent of the cuboid's height. \n\nThis differs from mixing width/height (which would involve swapping 3 cm with another dimension) or assuming equal segments (which isn't relevant here). \n\nThe error specifically arises from misaligning the diagram's spatial dimensions to the face's actual edges.",
