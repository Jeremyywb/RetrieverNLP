  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The sequence increases by 2 squares each term (3, 5, 7, ...), so the fourth term is 7 + 2 = 9.\n\nStudent's error: The student likely observed the first two differences (5 - 3 = 2, 7 - 5 = 2) but incorrectly assumed the difference itself increases by 1 after the third term, calculating 7 + 3 = 10.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student imposed a non-existent incremental change to the difference (assuming it becomes 3 instead of remaining 2), despite consistent differences in all given terms.\n\nMisconception link: This error stems from misidentifying the pattern as having increasing differences rather than a constant linear relationship, even after observing three terms with identical differences.\n\nDistinction: Unlike \"using only the first two terms,\" the student saw all three terms but still misapplied an additive pattern to the differences themselves, not the term count.",
