  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(57\\% = 0.57\\), \\(0.01 + 0.57 = 0.58 = 58\\%\\).\n\nStudent's error: Likely added \\(57\\) (as a whole number) and \\(0.01\\) directly: \\(57 + 0.01 = 57.01\\), then interpreted as \\(57.01\\%\\) or rounded to \\(57.1\\%\\).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated \\(57\\%\\) as \\(57\\) instead of converting it to \\(0.57\\), ignoring the place value difference between percentages and decimals. This caused them to add \\(57\\) (whole number) and \\(0.01\\) (hundredths place) as separate quantities rather than aligned decimal values.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly stems from adding digits without adjusting for place value, as the student failed to recognize that \\(57\\%\\) must first be converted to \\(0.57\\) to match the decimal's place value before addition.\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"removing the decimal point\" (which would yield \\(1\\%\\)) or misaligning decimal digits (which would require both terms to already be in decimal form). The error specifically involves treating a percentage as a whole number rather than a decimal fraction.",
