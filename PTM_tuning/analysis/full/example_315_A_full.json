  "explanation": "The correct first step requires rewriting both fractions with the common denominator \\( x(x-2) \\):  \n\\( \\frac{3}{x-2} = \\frac{3x}{x(x-2)} \\) and \\( \\frac{5}{x} = \\frac{5(x-2)}{x(x-2)} \\), leading to \\( \\frac{3x - 5(x-2)}{x(x-2)} \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly computed \\( \\frac{3-5}{x-2-x} \\), subtracting numerators (\\( 3-5 \\)) and denominators (\\( (x-2)-x \\)) directly.  \n\nThis error stems from treating fraction subtraction as linear subtraction of numerator terms and denominator terms separately, violating the fundamental rule that fractions require a common denominator before combining numerators.  \n\nThe misconception directly caused the student to bypass the necessary step of finding equivalent fractions with a common denominator, instead applying arithmetic subtraction to both components independently.  \n\nThis flaw is distinct from merely forgetting to find a common denominator, as the student actively misapplied subtraction to denominators in a way not aligned with fraction operations.  \n\nThe error specifically reflects a structural misunderstanding of fraction operations, not general algebraic handling of denominators.",
