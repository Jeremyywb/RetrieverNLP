  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires adding adjacent terms: \\(2a + (-b) = 2a - b\\).  \nThe student incorrectly computed \\(2a \\times (-b) = -2ab\\), treating addition as multiplication.  \nThe flaw stems from misinterpreting the pyramid's additive structure as requiring multiplication of terms.  \nThis confusion between operations caused them to replace term collection with term multiplication, producing a product instead of a sum.  \nThe error aligns with confusing addition with multiplication, distinct from incorrect term combination (e.g., \\(2a + (-b) \\neq -2ab\\) would not result from mere sign errors or coefficient mismanagement).  \nRelated misconceptions like combining unlike terms or incorrect addition would not explain the presence of a product term \\(ab\\) in the answer.",
