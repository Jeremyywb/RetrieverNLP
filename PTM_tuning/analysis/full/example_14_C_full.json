  "explanation": "The correct solution requires iterating \\( x_{n+1} = 5 - \\frac{1}{x_n} \\) until convergence. After sufficient iterations, the value stabilizes at approximately 4.7913, which rounds to 4.79 (two decimal places). \n\nThe student likely truncated the decimal expansion after one iteration step, or rounded prematurely during intermediate steps, resulting in 4.8. Their error stems from applying rounding criteria incorrectly: 4.7913 requires evaluating the third decimal digit (1) to determine the second decimal digit (9 remains unchanged). \n\nBy stopping at the first decimal place without considering the full precision required, the student failed to maintain the necessary accuracy through all iterations. This matches the \"rounds too much\" misconception rather than truncation or stopping iterations early, as the answer reflects improper rounding application rather than computational impatience. \n\nThe distinction lies in the presence of correct digits beyond the first decimal (4.7...) that were improperly discarded, unlike truncation errors that would preserve more digits but not round them.",
