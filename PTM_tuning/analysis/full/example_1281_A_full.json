  "explanation": "The equation \\(7 \\times 9 = 5 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 9\\) demonstrates distributivity: \\((5+2) \\times 9 = 5 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 9\\). The student incorrectly labeled this as commutativity. Their error stems from conflating the rearrangement of terms (commutativity) with the structural decomposition of multiplication over addition. They likely focused on the equality of products (all terms involve 9) but failed to recognize that 7 was decomposed into \\(5+2\\) and multiplied by 9 separately. This aligns with misidentifying the core operation (distribution of multiplication over addition) as mere order-swapping. The error differs from additive/multiplicative confusion because the equation explicitly maintains multiplicative relationships throughout.",
