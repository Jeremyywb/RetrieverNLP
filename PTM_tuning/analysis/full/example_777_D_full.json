  "explanation": "The correct construction requires setting the compass width equal to the line segment's length, ensuring the arcs intersect at points forming an equilateral triangle (yielding 60\u00b0 angles). The student incorrectly set the compass to \"at least the length of the line\" and drew arcs both above and below the line. \n\nBy using an arbitrary compass width exceeding the line's length, the student failed to guarantee equal radii needed for congruent arcs. This violates the geometric principle that equal radii from both endpoints create equidistant intersection points, a necessity for constructing the equilateral triangle. \n\nThe misconception that compass width (\"length of the arms\") directly controls angle size caused this error, as the student assumed adjusting the compass's span alone (rather than maintaining precise equality to the original segment) would suffice. This differs from related errors like misapplying bisectors or misplacing arcs, as the core flaw lies in misunderstanding the role of fixed compass radii in enforcing geometric congruence.",
