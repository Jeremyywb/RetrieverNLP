  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\sqrt{36\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2} = 6\\ \\mathrm{mm} \\).  \nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\( 36\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2 \\div 2 = 18\\ \\mathrm{mm} \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly interpreted square roots as division by 2. While the problem requires reversing the squaring operation (through square roots), they substituted halving instead. This directly stems from conflating inverse operations of exponentiation with linear scaling.  \n\nThe error is distinct from confusing squaring with doubling (which would involve calculating \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\)) or general confusion about multiplication by 2. The specific substitution of division for square rooting aligns exclusively with misidentifying the inverse operation of squaring.",
