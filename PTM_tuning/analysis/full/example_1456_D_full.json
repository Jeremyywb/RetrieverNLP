  "explanation": "The correct calculation squares the input: \\( 20^2 = 400 \\).\n\nThe student likely computed \\( 20 \\div 2 = 10 \\), replacing squaring with division by 2. \n\nThe error stems from interpreting the square operation as halving the number instead of multiplying it by itself. The misconception conflates the meaning of \"squared\" with division by 2, directly substituting the operation. \n\nThis differs from \"divides by the index,\" which would involve misapplying the exponent as a divisor (e.g., \\( 20 \\div 2 \\)) but shares the same numerical result. However, the key distinction is the misinterpretation of the operation itself (squaring vs. dividing), not merely misusing the exponent's value. \n\nNo other listed misconception explains substituting the operation more directly than this core confusion.",
