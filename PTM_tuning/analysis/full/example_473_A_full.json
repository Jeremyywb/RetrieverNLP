  "explanation": "The correct value calculation: In 43075, the digit 3 is in the thousands place, giving 3\u00d71000=3000. \n\nThe student's error shows they calculated 3\u00d710,000=30,000, placing the digit in the ten thousands position. \n\nThe flaw stems from misidentifying the place value column: The student shifted the 3 one position left (to ten thousands) instead of recognizing it occupies the thousands place in the five-digit number. \n\nThis directly aligns with a column misassignment (e.g., treating the second digit as ten thousands place rather than thousands), not a multiplication error. \n\nIt differs from \"confusing hundreds/thousands\" or \"multiplying incorrectly by 10,\" as the error specifically involves mislabeling the column itself. \n\nThe student\u2019s answer reflects a systemic place value misunderstanding, not a computational mistake.",
