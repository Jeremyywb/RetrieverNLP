  "explanation": "Correct solution:\nFor \\( t^2 = -45 \\):\n- A square of a real number cannot be negative\n- Therefore, no real solutions exist\n\nStudent's error with \\( t^2 - 45 = -45 \\):\n1. Adds 45 to both sides: \\( t^2 = 0 \\)\n2. Fails to recognize \\( t = 0 \\) as valid solution\n3. Incorrectly concludes no real solutions\n\nFlawed reasoning:\n- When constants canceled (\\(-45 + 45\\)), student disregarded remaining \\( t^2 \\)\n- Mistakenly treated equation as \"empty\" rather than \\( t^2 = 0 \\)\n- This matches the misconception of ignoring variable terms after coefficient cancellation\n\nDistinction from related errors:\n- Not about 0 being invalid (solution exists at 0)\n- Not about discriminants (equation reduces to degree 2 with solution)\n- Specifically about dismissing variable terms after apparent cancellation\n\nThe error occurred when handling equivalent transformations - student lost track of the variable term after eliminating constants, falsely interpreting the simplified equation as unsolvable.",
