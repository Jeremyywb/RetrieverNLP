  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 4.6 \\times 100 = 460\\% \\).\n\nIncorrect calculation: The student wrote \\( 4.6\\% \\) directly, equivalent to \\( 4.6 \\times 1 = 4.6\\% \\).\n\nThe student failed to multiply by 100, treating the decimal as a percentage by merely appending the \"%\" symbol. This reflects a confusion between the operations required for conversion: percentages are obtained by scaling decimals by 100, not by unit conversion. \n\nThe error aligns with the misconception of dividing instead of multiplying because the student effectively performed no scaling (equivalent to dividing by 1), ignoring the multiplicative relationship between decimals and percentages. This distinguishes it from decimal placement errors (which would involve partial scaling) or dividing by 1000 (which would produce a much smaller value). \n\nThe student\u2019s answer matches the original decimal precisely, confirming they omitted the critical multiplication step entirely.",
