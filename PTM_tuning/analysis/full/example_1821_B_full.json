  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Factors of 8 are {1,2,4,8}, factors of 20 are {1,2,4,5,10,20}. The intersection {1,2,4} contains the common factors. \n\nStudent's error: They selected 20, which is a factor of 20 but not 8 (since 8 \u00f7 20 = 0.4). \n\nReasoning flaw: The student confused \"common factor\" with \"multiple.\" They likely identified 20 as a multiple of both numbers (since 20 is 20\u00d71 and 8\u00d72.5), but failed to recognize that factors must divide both numbers exactly. \n\nMisconception link: This directly stems from conflating factors (divisors) with multiples (products), mistaking a shared multiple (20) for a shared divisor. \n\nDistinction: This isn't about division errors or associative properties - the core issue is misapplying the definition of factors vs. multiples. \n\nVerification: The error matches the misconception \"Identifies a multiple... but not a common multiple\" but reversed (selecting a multiple instead of a factor). However, the primary confusion is factor/multiple distinction.",
