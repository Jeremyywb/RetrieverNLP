  "explanation": "The transformation \\( y = -f(x) \\) negates each output value of \\( f \\), which geometrically corresponds to reflecting points across the x-axis (e.g., a point \\( (a, b) \\) becomes \\( (a, -b) \\)). The student incorrectly identified the reflection line as \\( y = x \\), which swaps coordinates (e.g., \\( (a, b) \\) becomes \\( (b, a) \\)) and corresponds to the inverse function. \n\nThe error stems from conflating the algebraic negation of \\( f(x) \\) (which affects y-values) with the geometric act of switching x and y coordinates. This aligns with the misconception that reflections inherently involve coordinate-swapping rather than sign inversion. \n\nThis differs from related misconceptions like confusing the x-axis with the y-axis or misidentifying \\( y = -x \\), as the student specifically associated the transformation with coordinate exchange (a property of \\( y = x \\)), not axis misattribution or sign inversion in the wrong variable.",
