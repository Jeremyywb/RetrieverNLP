  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows:\n- Adding 19: n +10 +10 -1 = n +19 (Jo's method)\n- Subtracting 19: n -10 -10 +1 = n -19 (Paul's method)\n\nThe student likely reasoned:\n- Accepted Jo's method because adding 10 twice (20) and correcting with -1 matches 19\n- Rejected Paul's method by interpreting \"-10 -10 +1\" as \"subtract 19\" = n -19, but mistakenly thought the +1 makes it n -19 +1 = n -18 instead\n\nThe flaw stems from misapplying inverse operations: the student failed to recognize that subtracting 20 (via two -10s) and adding 1 produces the same result as subtracting 19 (since -20 +1 = -19). This shows a disconnect in understanding how additive inverses combine, specifically that -20 +1 \u2260 -19 +0 but actually equals -19.\n\nThis better matches the commutativity-with-negatives misconception than related subtraction/confusion errors, as the error specifically involves mishandling the combination of negative operations (-20) and positive compensation (+1) rather than simply reversing operations. The student treated the compensation step as an independent addition rather than an integrated part of the subtraction process.",
