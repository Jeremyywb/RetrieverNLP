  "explanation": "The correct final step involves physically connecting the marked angle point to the original line segment endpoint using a straightedge. The student incorrectly identified protractor alignment (an earlier setup step) as the final action. Their reasoning likely conflated essential preparation steps (protractor placement) with the core construction task (drawing lines to form angles). This reflects a misunderstanding of procedural sequence in geometric constructions, where tool alignment precedes measurement and line creation. The error differs from listed related misconceptions, as it concerns step sequence rather than tool misuse or measurement inaccuracies. The student correctly identified a necessary protractor operation but misattributed its temporal position in the workflow.",
