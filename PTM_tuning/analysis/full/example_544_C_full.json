  "explanation": "The correct lines of symmetry must preserve both the rectangle's structure and the stars' orientations. The vertical line maintains the stars' upward-pointing tips upon reflection. However, reflecting horizontally flips each star's orientation (points downward), destroying symmetry.\n\nThe student likely considered both vertical and horizontal axes due to the rectangle's inherent symmetry and the stars' positional arrangement (die pattern). They failed to recognize that horizontal reflection alters the stars' directional orientation, violating symmetry.\n\nThe error stems from not accounting for how reflection affects component orientations. While the star positions are symmetric, their fixed upward direction isn't preserved under horizontal reflection. This directly connects to misunderstanding reflection as a \"flip\" operation impacting directional elements.\n\nThis explanation better fits than related misconceptions: the student didn't assume rotational symmetry implies line symmetry, nor did they invent diagonal lines. They correctly identified vertical/horizontal candidates but misjudged the horizontal case due to orientation changes.",
