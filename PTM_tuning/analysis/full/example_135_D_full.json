  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Convert 60% to fraction: 60% = \u00b3\u2044\u2085\n2. Subtract given fraction: \u00b3\u2044\u2085 - \u00b2\u2044\u2085 = \u00b9\u2044\u2085\n3. Convert \u00b9\u2044\u2085 to denominator 10: \u00b2\u2044\u2081\u2080\n\nStudent's incorrect process:\n1. Convert 60% to decimal: 0.6\n2. Convert given fraction \u00b2\u2044\u2085 to decimal: 0.4\n3. Treat 0.4 as the missing value instead of calculating 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the given fraction's decimal equivalent (0.4) as the solution rather than performing subtraction. This shows they conflated the representation of the input value (\u00b2\u2044\u2085 = 0.4) with the required output value, bypassing the calculation entirely. The error stems from misidentifying which quantity needed conversion rather than misunderstanding conversion mechanics.\n\nDistinction: This differs from decimal-fraction conversion errors because the student correctly converted \u00b2\u2044\u2085 to 0.4 but failed to recognize this was an input value, not the answer. The primary issue was misapplying conversions at the wrong problem stage rather than technical conversion errors.",
