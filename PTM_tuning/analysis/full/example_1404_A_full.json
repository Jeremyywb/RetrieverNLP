  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3^3 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27 \\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\).\n\nThe student treated the exponent as a multiplier but incorrectly used 2 instead of 3. This stems from conflating cubing with operations involving doubling or multiplying by 2, rather than understanding exponents as repeated multiplication. While \"multiplies by the index\" would produce \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\), the error matches a misapplication of doubling (mixing squaring/cubing with multiplying by 2). The distinct use of 2 instead of the actual exponent 3 shows confusion between exponentiation and linear scaling, not merely misapplying the given index.",
