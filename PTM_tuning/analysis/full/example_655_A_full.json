  "explanation": "To solve \\((-6) \\times \\color{gold}\\bigstar \\color{black} = -8\\), divide both sides by \\(-6\\):  \n\\(\\color{gold}\\bigstar \\color{black} = \\frac{-8}{-6} = \\frac{8}{6}\\).  \n\nThe student likely computed \\(\\frac{-6}{-8} = \\frac{6}{8}\\).  \n\nThis error stems from reversing the roles of dividend and divisor when isolating the variable. Instead of dividing \\(-8\\) by \\(-6\\), they divided \\(-6\\) by \\(-8\\).  \n\nThe misconception directly caused the inversion of the fraction\u2019s numerator and denominator, as the student treated the coefficient \\(-6\\) (the divisor) as the dividend.  \n\nThis differs from \"inverting the fraction when dividing,\" which involves reciprocals during fraction division, not misordering terms in a basic division step.",
