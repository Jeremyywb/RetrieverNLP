  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The sequence increases by 1 each term (common difference \\( d = 1 \\)). The \\( n \\)-th term formula is \\( 3 + (n-1)(1) \\). For \\( n = 10 \\): \\( 3 + 9 = 12 \\).\n\nStudent's likely calculation: The student multiplied the term position by 3 (the first term's value), resulting in \\( 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student assumed a multiplicative relationship (term position \u00d7 first term) instead of recognizing the additive structure. They treated the first term as a scaling factor rather than the starting point of a linear progression.\n\nConnection to misconception: This directly stems from interpreting the sequence as proportional to the term position, ignoring the constant additive change. The error is not about misapplying the common difference (e.g., \\( 10 \\times 1 \\)) but conflating the sequence's starting value with a multiplier.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike errors that multiply position by the common difference (which would yield \\( 10 \\times 1 = 10 \\)), this error specifically misuses the first term as a multiplier, reflecting a deeper confusion about linear vs. proportional relationships.",
