  "explanation": "The correct area calculation uses the perpendicular height: \\( 7\\,\\text{cm} \\times 3\\,\\text{cm} = 21\\,\\text{cm}^2 \\).\n\nThe student likely calculated: \\( 7\\,\\text{cm} \\times 4\\,\\text{cm} = 28\\,\\text{cm}^2 \\), mistakenly using the slanted height (4 cm) instead of the perpendicular height (3 cm).\n\nThis error stems from conflating the slanted side length with the vertical height required in the area formula. The student treated the 4 cm measurement (irrelevant for area calculation) as equivalent to the true height, disregarding the right-angle marking that identifies 3 cm as the valid height. \n\nThis directly matches the misconception of using an incorrect dimension (slanted height) rather than mistaking the formula for perimeter (which would involve summing lengths) or assuming all given numbers must be multiplied. The error specifically involves misidentifying which geometric attribute corresponds to the formula's height parameter.",
