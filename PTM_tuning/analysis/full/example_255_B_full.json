  "explanation": "To convert \\( \\frac{13}{5} \\) correctly:\n1. \\( 13 \u00f7 5 = 2 \\) with remainder \\( 3 \\)\n2. Result: \\( 2 \\frac{3}{5} \\)\n\nThe student calculated \\( 1 \\frac{3}{5} \\), implying:\n1. They used \\( 13 - (5\u00d71) = 8 \\), but incorrectly treated the remainder as \\( 3 \\)\n2. This suggests they misidentified the quotient by taking the tens digit (1) from 13 instead of calculating division\n\nThe flaw occurred at the division step: The student extracted the digit \"1\" from the numerator's tens place (13) as the whole number, bypassing division. This directly caused the quotient to be undercounted by 1. The error aligns with misusing place value digits instead of performing division, not confusion between remainders/quotients or improper simplification. Related misconceptions about reversing whole/remainder or misassigning division components don't explain the specific 1\u21922 discrepancy here.",
