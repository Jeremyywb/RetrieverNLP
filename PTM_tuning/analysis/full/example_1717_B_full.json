  "explanation": "Correct first step: Multiply both sides by \\(6r\\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{5r+6}{6r} \\times 6r = 7 \\times 6r \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5r+6=42r\n\\]\n\nStudent's incorrect step: Reduced the fraction \\(\\frac{5r+6}{6r}\\) by cancelling the 6 in \\(6r\\) with the 6 in the numerator's constant term, resulting in \\(5r+1=7r\\).\n\nReasoning flaw: The student treated additive terms (the \"+6\" in the numerator) as multiplicative factors, incorrectly cancelling the 6 in \\(6r\\) with the standalone 6 in \\(5r+6\\). This assumes common factors exist across addition boundaries in the numerator, violating fraction simplification rules.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error stems from misapplying cancellation to non-factor terms. The 6 in \\(6r\\) is a factor, but the 6 in \\(5r+6\\) is an added term, making cancellation invalid.\n\nDistinction: Unlike distributing the denominator (which would divide both \\(5r\\) and \\(6\\) by \\(6r\\)), this error specifically misidentifies additive terms as cancellable factors. It also differs from improper fraction simplification via addition/subtraction, which would alter numerator and denominator equally.",
