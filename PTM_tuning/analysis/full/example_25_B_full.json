  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{4\\, \\text{m}}{10\\, \\text{hr}} = 0.4\\, \\text{m/hr} \\).  \nStudent's error: \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40\\, \\text{m/hr} \\).  \n\nThe student inverted the required operation, multiplying distance and time instead of dividing distance by time. This suggests a misapplication of the speed formula's structure, where they associated the relationship between quantities with multiplication rather than division.  \n\nThe error aligns with confusing the formula's division operation as multiplication, distinct from merely swapping numerator/denominator (which would produce \\( 10/4 = 2.5 \\)) or other arithmetic errors. The direct multiplication of given values matches a flawed heuristic to \"combine\" numbers in word problems without correctly interpreting the formula.  \n\nRelated misconceptions like dividing time by distance or misinterpreting fraction notation are ruled out, as those would yield different incorrect results (e.g., \\( 2.5 \\)) instead of \\( 40 \\).",
