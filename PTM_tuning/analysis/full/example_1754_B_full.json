  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The area under the speed-time graph from 8s to 10s is a trapezium. Using the formula \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times (v_1 + v_2) \\times \\Delta t\\), the distance is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times (15 + 24) \\times 2 = 39 \\, \\text{m}\\).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely calculated \\((24) \\times (10 - 8) = 48\\), treating the area as a rectangle with height equal to the final speed (24 m/s) instead of averaging the initial and final speeds.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student assumed the speed remained constant at the final value over the interval, ignoring the trapezoidal shape of the graph. This caused them to use a rectangle area formula instead of the trapezium formula.\n\nMisconception link: The error directly stems from treating the graph as a rectangle (constant speed) rather than recognizing the need to average the changing speeds. This matches the misconception that the shape does not affect the area calculation, as they applied the wrong geometric formula.\n\nDistinction: This is distinct from forgetting to divide by 2 in the trapezium formula (which would yield 78 m) or misunderstanding the trapezium formula entirely. The error specifically reflects a failure to account for the graph's increasing slope.",
