  "explanation": "The correct equation \\( x=0 \\) represents all points where the x-coordinate is 0, regardless of y. The student wrote \\( y=x \\), which defines a diagonal line where y equals x. \n\nThe error stems from conflating the axis orientation with variable equality. The student likely reasoned that since the y-axis relates to the y-variable, its equation must explicitly involve y. However, they incorrectly translated this into an equality between x and y (\\( y=x \\)) rather than isolating the fixed coordinate (x=0). \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of reversing x and y in a symmetric sense: treating the y-axis as requiring a y-variable equation (like the x-axis uses y=0) but incorrectly maintaining equality between variables instead of fixing x. \n\nIt differs from simply swapping axes (which would yield \\( y=0 \\)) or confusing vertical/horizontal formats (e.g., writing \\( y=0 \\) for the y-axis). The error specifically introduces a dependency between variables where none exists for the y-axis.",
