  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 2}{7 \\times 3} = \\frac{12}{21} = \\frac{4}{7} \\).\n\nStudent's error: \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{6 + 2}{7 \\times 3} = \\frac{8}{21} \\).\n\nThe student added numerators (6 + 2 = 8) instead of multiplying them (6 \u00d7 2 = 12), while correctly multiplying denominators (7 \u00d7 3 = 21). This reflects a conflation of addition and multiplication rules: they applied addition's numerator handling to multiplication while retaining the correct denominator multiplication. \n\nThis distinguishes from related errors like cross-multiplying (which would produce \\( \\frac{18}{14} \\)) or adding denominators (which would yield \\( \\frac{8}{10} \\)). The error specifically stems from mixing addition\u2019s numerator rule with multiplication\u2019s denominator rule.",
