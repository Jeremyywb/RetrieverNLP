  "explanation": "The correct equation requires first subtracting 6 from the number \\( n \\), then dividing by 3: \\( \\frac{n-6}{3}=21 \\).  \nThe student instead subtracted 6 after dividing: \\( \\frac{n}{3}-6=21 \\).  \nThe error stems from misinterpreting the order of operations described in the problem. The phrase \"take away six and then divide\" specifies subtraction must precede division.  \nThe student applied operations strictly left-to-right, performing division first due to its position in the sentence, rather than prioritizing subtraction as the first step.  \nThis matches \"carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order,\" not merely a bracket omission, as the error persists despite the problem's explicit sequencing.  \nRelated misconceptions about brackets or right-to-left ordering are less relevant here, as the misordering occurred without bracket usage cues.",
