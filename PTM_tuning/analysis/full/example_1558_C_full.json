  "explanation": "The correct answer requires recognizing that a rhombus has four equal sides while a rectangle requires four right angles but not necessarily equal sides. The student incorrectly equated \"four equal sides\" with both shapes. \n\nThe error stems from conflating side length equality with angle requirements. The student likely reasoned: \"If a square has four equal sides and is both a rectangle and rhombus, then all rectangles must have equal sides.\" This assumes rectangles must be squares rather than understanding that squares are a special case where rectangle and rhombus properties intersect.\n\nThis specifically shows a failure to distinguish between general category properties (rectangles require 90\u00b0 angles) and special case requirements (squares add equal sides). It differs from general parallelogram misunderstandings because the student correctly associates rhombus with equal sides but incorrectly extends that property to all rectangles through overgeneralization of square characteristics.\n\nThe primary flaw is assuming all rectangles automatically inherit rhombus properties rather than recognizing their definitions as separate constraints (angle requirements vs side equality) that only coincide in squares.",
