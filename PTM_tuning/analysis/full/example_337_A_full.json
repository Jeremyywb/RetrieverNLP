  "explanation": "To convert 52% to a decimal: 52 \u00f7 100 = 0.52. \nThe student likely calculated 52 \u00f7 1000 = 0.052 instead. \n\nThe error stems from dividing by 1000 rather than 100 when converting the percentage, indicating a failure to recognize that percentages represent parts per hundred. This miscalculation matches Jo's incorrect value of 0.052. \n\nThe related misconception of dividing by 10 (which would produce 5.2) does not apply here, as the student's result shows an extra order-of-magnitude error. The flaw is specifically tied to using an incorrect divisor (1000) rather than misplacing decimal points or confusing division with multiplication.",
