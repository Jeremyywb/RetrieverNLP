  "explanation": "The correct interpretation recognizes that identical dashes on polygon sides universally indicate equal length in geometric notation. The student's answer (\"They are straight\") misattributes the dashes' purpose. The error stems from interpreting the dashes as describing line type (straight vs. curved) rather than quantitative measurement. This conflates the fundamental property of polygons (all sides are inherently straight) with symbolic notation for length equivalence. The confusion specifically relates to misunderstanding standard geometric markings, distinct from errors about parallel lines or regularity requirements where angles would also need consideration. The student focused on visible line characteristics rather than encoded metric relationships.",
