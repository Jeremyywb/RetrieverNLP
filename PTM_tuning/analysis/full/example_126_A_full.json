  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Total base: 13 cm\n- Top horizontal width: 6 cm \u2192 Shaded rectangle's width = 13 - 6 = 7 cm\n- Total height: 14 cm\n- Top rectangle height: 8 cm \u2192 Shaded rectangle's height = 14 - 8 = 6 cm\n- Area: 7 \u00d7 6 = 42 cm\u00b2\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n- Assumed shaded rectangle dimensions matched visible values from the top rectangle:\n  - Width: 6 cm (top's horizontal width)\n  - Height: 8 cm (top's vertical height)\n- Area: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48 cm\u00b2\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student directly reused the top rectangle's dimensions (6 cm and 8 cm) instead of deriving the shaded rectangle's dimensions through subtraction. They failed to recognize that composite shapes require calculating missing lengths by subtracting known lengths from totals. This aligns with the misconception about missing lengths in composite shapes, not confusion about rectangle properties or width/height reversal. Related misconceptions like mixing width/height are less applicable because the error stems from missing subtractions, not attribute swapping.",
