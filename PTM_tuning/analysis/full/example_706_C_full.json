  "explanation": "The correct identification requires recognizing that angles positioned in matching locations relative to the transversal and their respective parallel lines (both above the transversal and on the right side of each line) are corresponding angles.\n\nThe student likely observed that both angles were on the same side of the transversal but failed to note that they were positioned externally (above the parallel lines) rather than internally between them. This led them to incorrectly classify the angles as co-interior.\n\nThe error stems from conflating the spatial requirements for co-interior angles (which must lie between parallel lines) with the broader \"same transversal side\" criterion. The misconception specifically caused the student to disregard the necessity of interior positioning when applying the \"co-interior\" label.\n\nThis explanation aligns with the primary misconception better than the related ones: the error wasn't about angle sums or vertical angles, nor was it a failure to recognize parallel lines (which were present). The confusion was purely about angle placement relative to the lines.",
