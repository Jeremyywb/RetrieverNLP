  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \nDivide both sides by 2:  \n\\(2x > 7 \\implies x > \\frac{7}{2} \\implies x > 3.5\\)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:  \nAfter dividing 7 by 2, they likely converted 3.5 to 4 instead of retaining the decimal.  \n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student treated the exact decimal result (3.5) as requiring rounding to the nearest whole number, erroneously increasing the value.  \n\nMisconception linkage:  \nThis error stems from assuming numerical solutions must be integers, leading to premature rounding. By rounding 3.5 up to 4, the student incorrectly narrowed the solution set (e.g., excluding valid values like 3.6).  \n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis is not a case of misapplying inequality properties or believing solutions are single values, but specifically altering the precise boundary through unwarranted rounding. The error differs from \"rounding too early\" (e.g., approximating mid-calculation) because the rounding occurred after correctly solving \\(x > 3.5\\).",
