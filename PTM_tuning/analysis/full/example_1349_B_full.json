  "explanation": "To eliminate \\( l \\), the correct method multiplies the first equation by 3: \\( 3(2l + 3m) = 3(13) \\rightarrow 6l + 9m = 39 \\), and the second by 2: \\( 2(3l + 4m) = 2(17) \\rightarrow 6l + 8m = 34 \\). The student multiplied the coefficients of \\( l \\) correctly (6\\( l \\) in both) but failed to multiply the constants: they wrote \\( 6l + 9m = 13 \\) (instead of 39) and \\( 6l + 8m = 17 \\) (instead of 34). \n\nThe error shows the student multiplied only the variable terms, not the entire equation. This occurs when a learner treats the equality as isolated terms rather than a balanced relationship. The misconception stems from believing multiplication applies selectively to parts of the equation (e.g., terms with \\( l \\)) rather than all terms. \n\nThis is distinct from errors about LCM selection or partial elimination-term adjustment: here, the coefficients for \\( l \\) were correctly aligned, but the constants were neglected entirely. The flaw is specifically in unequal scaling of both sides.",
