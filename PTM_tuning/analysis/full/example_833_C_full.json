  "explanation": "The correct reflection over \\( y = x \\) swaps coordinates: \\( (2,1) \\rightarrow (1,2) \\). The student's answer \\( (0,1) \\) suggests they subtracted 2 from the \\( x \\)-coordinate while leaving \\( y \\) unchanged. \n\nThis error indicates the student treated \\( y = x \\) as a vertical line \\( x = 1 \\), not a diagonal. Reflecting \\( (2,1) \\) over \\( x = 1 \\) would yield \\( (0,1) \\), matching their answer. \n\nThe flaw stems from misinterpreting \\( y = x \\) as a vertical axis rather than recognizing it requires coordinate swapping. This directly aligns with confusing the diagonal reflection line for a vertical axis, not merely translating or misapplying direction. Other misconceptions like flipping direction or keeping points on the line unchanged don't explain the specific coordinate shift to \\( (0,1) \\).",
