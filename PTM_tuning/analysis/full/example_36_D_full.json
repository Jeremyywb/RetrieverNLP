  "explanation": "The correct calculation combines four instances of \\( d \\) through addition: \\( d + d + d + d = 4d \\).  \nThe student incorrectly treated repeated addition as exponentiation, writing \\( d^{4} \\).  \n\nThe error occurred because the student multiplied the variable terms (\\( d \\times d \\times d \\times d \\)) instead of summing their coefficients. This stems from conflating additive operations with multiplicative ones when handling repeated variables.  \n\nThe misconception directly substitutes multiplication for addition when simplifying expressions, rather than recognizing that like terms require summing coefficients. This distinguishes it from related errors involving exponents or power notation, as the student applied multiplication correctly but in the wrong context (addition of terms, not multiplication of factors).",
