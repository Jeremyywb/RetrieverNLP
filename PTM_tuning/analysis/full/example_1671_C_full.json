  "explanation": "The correct calculation finds the LCM of 12 and 8 by identifying their prime factors (12 = 2\u00b2\u00d73, 8 = 2\u00b3) and selecting the maximum exponents (2\u00b3\u00d73 = 24). The student incorrectly calculated 12\u00d78 = 96. The error stems from assuming the product of the two numbers directly yields their next simultaneous occurrence, disregarding shared factors. This misconception conflates the LCM with the product, ignoring that LCM requires only the necessary factors to cover both numbers' intervals. Unlike forgetting to include common factors in LCM steps, this error entirely replaces LCM with multiplication. Similarly, it differs from HCF confusion, as HCF would produce 4 here, not 96.",
