  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes \\( 3g \\) as a term because it is a single component in the expression \\( 6 - 3g \\), formed by multiplying a coefficient and variable. The student labeled \\( 3g \\) as an \"equation,\" which requires an equality sign between two expressions. \n\nThe error stems from misidentifying a component within an expression as an equation. The student likely focused on \\( 3g \\) being a mathematical object involving variables but failed to recognize that an equation must assert equivalence (e.g., \\( 3g = 6 \\)) rather than being a standalone element. This directly aligns with confusing terms with equations, as the student conflated the structural requirements of an equation (equality) with the simpler concept of a term within an expression. \n\nThis differs from confusing expressions with terms (the full \\( 6 - 3g \\) is the expression, not \\( 3g \\)) or variables with equations (\\( 3g \\) contains a variable but is not an equation). The error specifically reflects a lack of clarity about the definition of an equation versus a term.",
