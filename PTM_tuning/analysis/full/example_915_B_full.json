  "explanation": "The correct ratio calculation requires comparing tables (3) to chairs (1) directly: 3:1.\n\nThe student's answer (3:4) suggests they added chairs to tables (3+1=4) and presented tables:total instead of tables:chairs.\n\nThe error stems from interpreting the ratio as part-to-whole (tables to total items) rather than part-to-part (tables to chairs). This converts the relationship into a fraction (3/4) misrepresented as a ratio.\n\nThis directly aligns with part-to-whole confusion, not merely reversing ratio terms (which would yield 1:3) or misapplying fraction conversion (which requires explicit fraction-to-ratio translation steps). The key distinction is the student's focus on total quantity instead of the relationship between the two distinct quantities specified in the question.",
