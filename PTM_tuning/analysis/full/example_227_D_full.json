  "explanation": "The inequality \\( d \\leq h \\) requires \\( d \\) to be less than or equal to \\( h \\). For the correct answer \\( d=2, h=-4 \\), \\( 2 \\leq -4 \\) is false. The student chose \\( d=-2, h=2 \\), where \\( -2 \\leq 2 \\) is true. \n\nThe student likely reversed the inequality direction, interpreting it as \\( d \\geq h \\). Applying this reversed logic, they checked if \\( -2 \\geq 2 \\), which is false, leading them to incorrectly select this pair. This directly aligns with confusing the inequality symbol's direction rather than misapplying absolute values or counter-example criteria. Other misconceptions (e.g., misjudging negative magnitudes) don't apply here, as \\( h=2 \\) is clearly greater than \\( d=-2 \\).",
