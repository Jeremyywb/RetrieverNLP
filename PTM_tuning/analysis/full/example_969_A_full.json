  "explanation": "The correct calculation finds the temperature difference by subtracting the lower value from the higher one: \\(5 - (-7) = 12\\). The student likely computed \\(5 - 7 = -2\\) instead, interpreting the result as \"2\u00b0C colder.\" \n\nThis error stems from misapplying subtraction with negative numbers: they treated \\(-7\\) as a positive value to subtract from 5, rather than recognizing that subtracting \\(-7\\) equates to adding 7. This aligns with the misconception of subtracting the absolute value of a negative number instead of adding it. \n\nThe student did not ignore both signs entirely (which might yield \\(5 + 7 = 12\\), but misinterpreted as colder) or reverse the direction on the number line (which could produce \\(-12\\)). The specific misstep occurred in handling the negative subtrahend during the difference calculation.",
