  "explanation": "To find x-intercepts for \\( y=(x-3)(x-5) \\), set \\( y=0 \\):\n\\[\n0=(x-3)(x-5) \\implies x=3 \\ \\text{or} \\ x=5 \\Rightarrow \\text{intercepts at } (3,0) \\ \\text{and} \\ (5,0).\n\\]\nThe student incorrectly wrote \\( (3,5) \\), merging the roots \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) into a single coordinate pair. This suggests they treated the roots as both coordinates of one point rather than distinct \\( x \\)-values paired with \\( y=0 \\). Specifically, they failed to recognize that \\( y=0 \\) at all \\( x \\)-intercepts, leading them to conflate the two \\( x \\)-values into a single non-intercept point. \n\nThis aligns with misunderstanding how coordinates define points on axes: the student did not associate each root with a separate intercept where \\( y=0 \\). It differs from misconceptions like reversing sign errors (e.g., writing \\( (-3,0) \\)) or assuming equal coordinates (e.g., \\( (3,3) \\)), as the error uniquely stems from misassigning the roots to both coordinates.",
