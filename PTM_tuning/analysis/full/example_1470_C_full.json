  "explanation": "The correct modal grade is determined by identifying the grade with the highest frequency: Grade 4 (frequency=9). \n\nThe student selected 9, which is the frequency value itself rather than the corresponding grade. This error occurs when misinterpreting the mode as the numerical value of the frequency (9) instead of the category (Grade 4) tied to that frequency. \n\nThe flaw stems from conflating the role of the frequency column (how often a grade occurs) with the data category (the grades themselves). The student focused on the largest number in the frequency column but failed to map it back to the associated grade. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of confusing the \"most common frequency\" (the count) with the \"grade that has the highest frequency.\" It is distinct from selecting the sum (which would require adding all frequencies) or range-related errors (which involve spread, not frequency maxima).",
