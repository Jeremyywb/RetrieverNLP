  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the conversion \\(1\\ \\mathrm{L} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\), giving \\(4 \\times 1000 = 4000\\). The student multiplied \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\), suggesting they used a linear conversion factor of 10 instead of the cubed factor. \n\nThe error stems from treating volume conversion as a linear measurement. The student likely knew \\(1\\ \\mathrm{dm} = 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\) but failed to cube this ratio when converting \\(1\\ \\mathrm{L} (=1\\ \\mathrm{dm}^3)\\) to \\(\\mathrm{cm}^3\\). This caused them to use \\(10\\) instead of \\(10^3 = 1000\\). \n\nThis directly aligns with the \"does not cube the conversion factor\" misconception. It differs from the \"thinks \\(1\\ \\mathrm{L} = 100\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\)\" error, which would produce \\(400\\), not \\(40\\). The student's specific miscalculation shows they recognized a unit relationship but neglected its three-dimensional nature.",
