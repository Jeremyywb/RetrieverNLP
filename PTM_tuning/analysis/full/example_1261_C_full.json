  "explanation": "The correct analysis starts by rewriting \\( x - y = 2 \\) as \\( y = x - 2 \\), revealing a positive gradient (1) and y-intercept at (0, -2). This places it in region B (intersection). \n\nThe student likely rewrote the equation correctly to \\( y = x - 2 \\) and recognized the positive gradient. However, they incorrectly concluded the y-intercept was not at (0, -2). This stems from misinterpreting the \"-2\" in \\( y = mx - c \\) as a positive intercept value (c) rather than -c. \n\nThis caused them to exclude the line from the \"crosses at (0, -2)\" set, placing it only in the \"positive gradient\" set (C). The error aligns with misapplying the relationship between the constant term and intercept sign in slope-intercept form, distinct from confusing gradient direction or general intercept sign errors. The student correctly identified the slope but misread the intercept's sign due to this structural misunderstanding.",
