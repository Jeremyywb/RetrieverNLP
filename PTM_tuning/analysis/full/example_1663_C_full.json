  "explanation": "The correct solution identifies the point where \\( x = 30 \\) mph on the graph and reads the corresponding \\( y \\)-value (journey time) as 7 hours. The student, however, likely associated the given speed (30 mph) directly with the time (30 hours) without properly mapping \\( x \\)-values to \\( y \\)-values. This indicates they treated the axes independently rather than interpreting coordinates as paired values. Specifically, they likely took the numerical value of the speed (30) and assigned it to the time axis, ignoring the graph's structure. This aligns with mixing up \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values of coordinates, as opposed to misreading the axes' labels or scales. The error is distinct from confusing inverse proportionality (e.g., assuming time halves when speed doubles) because the graph explicitly provides the correct coordinate pair (30,7), which the student failed to interpret correctly.",
