  "explanation": "The correct expansion shows \\( (m+a)(m+b) = m^2 + (a+b)m + ab \\). Matching coefficients gives \\( ab = -14 \\).\n\nThe student likely identified the correct pair \\( a=7 \\), \\( b=-2 \\) (or vice versa) that sums to 5, but treated their product as \\( 7 \\times 2 = 14 \\) instead of \\( 7 \\times (-2) \\). This indicates they disregarded the negative sign attached to one factor when computing the product.\n\nThe flaw stems from failing to preserve the negative value of one term during multiplication. While the student recognized the need for opposite signs (since \\( a+b=5 \\) and \\( ab<0 \\)), they incorrectly calculated the magnitude of the product rather than its signed value.\n\nThis directly corresponds to mishandling signed numbers in products, not errors in sign determination during factoring. It's distinct from misconceptions about sign operations in sums or quadratic expansion patterns, as the student correctly identified the required pair of numbers but failed to apply sign rules to their product.",
