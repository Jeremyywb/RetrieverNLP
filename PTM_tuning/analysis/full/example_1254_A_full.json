  "explanation": "The correct calculation identifies \\( h \\) as the perpendicular height given in the problem (5 cm). The student, however, appears to have selected the length of the longer parallel side (6 cm) as \\( h \\). This error stems from conflating the formula's requirement for a perpendicular height with the measurement of one of the trapezium's bases. By incorrectly assigning a parallel side's length to \\( h \\), the student disregarded the geometric definition of height as the perpendicular distance between the bases. This aligns with a failure to distinguish between the roles of bases and height in the formula, rather than confusing slant height with height (since 6 cm is not the slant height). Unlike errors involving slant heights or base substitutions in the \\( \\frac{a+b}{2} \\) term, this mistake specifically misattributes a base's length to the height parameter.",
