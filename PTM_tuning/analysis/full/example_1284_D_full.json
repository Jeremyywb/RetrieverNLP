By starting division with the rightmost digit (1 in 0.1) rather than progressing left-to-right through the decimal structure, the student's quotient digits became misaligned by one decimal place.\n\nThis matches the primary misconception of starting division at the wrong end of the dividend, not the related power-of-10 error which would involve decimal shifts before/after division. The student maintained digit relationships (2-5 sequence matches correct 25) but misplaced their decimal position due to flawed initial digit selection.",
