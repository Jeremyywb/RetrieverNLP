  "explanation": "The correct simplification is \\( 4a \\), where the coefficient 4 is written before the variable \\( a \\). \n\nThe student incorrectly transformed \\( a \\times 4 \\) into \\( a^4 \\), replacing multiplication with exponentiation. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the multiplication operator (\\( \\times \\)) as an instruction to apply an exponent. The student conflated the algebraic convention of writing coefficients before variables with the entirely distinct concept of raising a base to a power. \n\nThis directly reflects a misunderstanding of how multiplication interacts with variables: they treated repeated multiplication (implied by exponents) as equivalent to scalar multiplication, despite these being separate operations. \n\nThis differs from the related misconception of writing \\( a^n \\) as \\( na \\), which involves reversing the roles of coefficients and exponents. Here, the flaw specifically involves misapplying the operator itself, not merely misordering terms.",
