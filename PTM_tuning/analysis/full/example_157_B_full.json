  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n\\[\n(5 - 6 + 12 - 11)s = (0)s = 0\n\\]\n\nStudent's calculation:\n\\[\n(5 - 6 + 12 - 11)s = 0s\n\\]\n\nThe student correctly summed coefficients to 0 but retained the variable. This stems from misunderstanding that a coefficient of zero eliminates the variable term entirely. They treated \"0s\" as a required form despite equivalent simplification to 0. This differs from coefficient combination errors because their arithmetic was correct - the flaw lies in handling the zero coefficient's relationship to the variable. Related misconceptions about arithmetic operations or term identification don't apply here, as only the final representation of the zero term was mishandled.",
