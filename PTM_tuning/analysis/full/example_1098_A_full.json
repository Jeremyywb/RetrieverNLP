  "explanation": "Correct calculation after factoring denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{3x+1}{3} \\times \\frac{12}{(3x-1)(3x+1)} = \\frac{\\cancel{3x+1}}{3} \\times \\frac{12}{(3x-1)\\cancel{(3x+1)}} = \\frac{12}{3(3x-1)} = \\frac{4}{3x-1}\n\\]\n\nStudent's likely incorrect simplification:\n\\[\n\\frac{3x+1}{3} \\times \\frac{12}{(3x-1)(3x+1)} \\rightarrow \\frac{12}{9x-1}\n\\]\n\nThe student canceled \\((3x+1)\\) but failed to properly simplify the remaining constants and factors. They incorrectly treated the denominator \\(3 \\times (3x-1)\\) as \\(9x-1\\) instead of \\(9x-3\\), suggesting they multiplied \\(3 \\times 3x\\) correctly but neglected to multiply \\(3 \\times (-1)\\). This indicates a failure to fully distribute the constant factor across both terms in the binomial \\((3x-1)\\) after cancellation.\n\nThe error stems from partial simplification of the denominator's multiplicative components, where only the variable term was scaled by the constant factor while the constant term was ignored. This matches the misconception of incomplete factor handling during cancellation, distinct from related errors like improper common factor identification or unequal division of numerator/denominator terms. The student's focus on canceling \\((3x+1)\\) overshadowed proper attention to distributing the remaining factor of 3 across all terms in the denominator.",
