  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n3(4x + 6) = 12x + 18  \n-2(x - 9) = -2x + 18  \nCombined: 12x + 18 - 2x + 18 = 10x + 36  \nThus A = 10\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n3(4x + 6) - 2(x - 9)  \n= 4x + 6 - x - 9  \n= (4x - x) + (6 - 9)  \n= 3x - 3 \u2192 A = 3\n\nFlawed reasoning:\nThe student treated coefficients 3 and -2 as additive terms rather than multiplicative factors. They subtracted 2 from 3 instead of distributing:  \n- Mistook 3(4x) as 3 + 4x rather than 12x  \n- Treated -2(x) as -x instead of -2x\n\nThis demonstrates a failure to apply distribution to variable terms, specifically multiplying coefficients with variables. The error stems from misinterpreting scalar multiplication as simple addition/subtraction of coefficients rather than scaling.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike \"only multiplies second term\" or \"forgets brackets,\" this error shows consistent misapplication of coefficients to both terms in each bracket - but through addition, not multiplication. The core issue is misrepresenting the distributive operation itself.",
