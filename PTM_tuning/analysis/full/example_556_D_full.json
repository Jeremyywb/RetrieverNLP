  "explanation": "Correct calculation: To solve \\(9y = k\\), divide both sides by 9: \\(y = \\frac{k}{9}\\).\n\nIncorrect step: Subtracting 9 from both sides: \\(9y - 9 = k - 9\\).\n\nThe student misapplied subtraction as the inverse operation for multiplication. They treated the coefficient 9 as an additive term rather than a multiplicative factor. This caused them to use subtraction (\"undoing\" addition) instead of division (the actual inverse for multiplication). \n\nThis error directly stems from conflating inverse operations for addition/subtraction with those for multiplication/division. The student recognized the need to reverse an operation but selected the wrong inverse. This differs from related misconceptions like confusing operation directions (e.g., adding instead of multiplying) or misinterpreting symbols, as the error specifically substitutes subtraction for division rather than misidentifying symbols or operations entirely.",
