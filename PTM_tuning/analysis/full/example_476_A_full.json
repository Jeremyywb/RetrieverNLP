  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 72% = 72/100 = (72\u00f74)/(100\u00f74) = 18/25  \nStudent's incorrect steps: Treated \"72%\" as 7 (whole number) + 2/100 = 7 2/100  \nFlawed reasoning: The student split the percentage's digits into separate components (70 and 2) instead of recognizing \"72\" as a unified numerator. This reflects a misinterpretation of mixed number notation, where 72/100 was erroneously divided into an integer (7) and a fraction (2/100) based on digit placement.  \nConnection to misconception: The error stems from treating percentage digits as distinct parts to be converted separately, rather than maintaining the original value as a single fraction over 100.  \nDistinction from related errors: Unlike a denominator confusion (e.g., using 10 instead of 100), the error specifically misapplies mixed number structure by splitting the percentage's numerical value incorrectly.",
