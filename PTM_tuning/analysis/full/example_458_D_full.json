  "explanation": "Correct solution: Total parts = 3 (yoghurt) + 1 (water) = 4. Water fraction = 1/4.\n\nThe student assumed the problem required absolute quantities (e.g., total volume) to calculate fractions, not recognizing that ratios alone define proportional relationships. They misapplied ratio interpretation by treating \"3:1\" as incomplete data requiring additional values to convert to fractions, rather than understanding it inherently specifies parts of a whole.\n\nThis aligns with the \"missing information\" misconception because the student didn't recognize that summing ratio terms creates a denominator (3+1=4) to calculate fractions. They stopped at \"water is 1 part\" without realizing the total parts system is fully defined by the ratio itself.\n\nIt's distinct from ratio order errors (which would produce 3/4) or equivalent ratio confusion (which could lead to scaling mistakes but still yield a numerical answer). The core issue was interpreting the ratio as insufficient data rather than a complete proportional system.",
