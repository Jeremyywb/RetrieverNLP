  "explanation": "The correct count for a cuboid's vertices is 8, calculated by recognizing that each corner (where three edges meet) is a distinct vertex. The student likely counted visible vertices in the diagram, missing one hidden vertex due to the 2D representation. For example, a standard perspective drawing of a cuboid shows 7 visible vertices, with one occluded. The student's misconception caused them to tally only the visible points rather than accounting for all spatial corners. This directly ties to misinterpreting the diagram's 3D structure in a 2D format. Unlike confusing edges/vertices (which would yield 12) or 2D cross-section errors (which would yield 4), this error specifically stems from diagram interpretation.",
