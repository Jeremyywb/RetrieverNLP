  "explanation": "The correct reasoning requires verifying both shape and size: congruent shapes must have equal corresponding sides and angles. Tom's triangles satisfy this (same shape/size, different orientation), while Katie's differ in size. \n\nThe student likely observed that both pairs are triangles (same shape) but neglected to check size. By equating \"same shape\" with congruence regardless of scale, they concluded both are congruent. \n\nThis directly stems from failing to recognize that congruence mandates identical size, not just shape. They focused on triangular form but ignored the size difference in Katie's case. \n\nThis misconception differs from confusing congruence with flexibility in side lengths (which would involve altering proportions) or not understanding enlargement effects (which requires grasping scaling). Here, the error is simpler: omitting the size requirement entirely while assessing congruence.",
