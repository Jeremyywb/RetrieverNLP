  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires ordering the numbers: -6, 1, 5, 5, 17. The range is \\(17 - (-6) = 23\\). \n\nThe student likely calculated the mean: \\(\\frac{1 + 5 + 5 + 17 + (-6)}{5} = \\frac{22}{5} = 4.4\\), then rounded to 5. This shows they confused the definition of range (max - min) with the average. \n\nThe error directly stems from conflating measures of central tendency (mean) with measures of spread (range). This distinguishes it from other listed misconceptions like using the highest value alone (17) or misapplying order-dependent subtraction (e.g., \\(17 - 12\\)), which would not produce 5. The answer matches the rounded mean, not an alternative calculation.",
