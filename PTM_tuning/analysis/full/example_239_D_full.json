  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes quadratic functions can have graphs opening upward (positive leading coefficient) or downward (negative leading coefficient), making both Tom and Katie correct. The student rejected both graphs, likely operating under the assumption that quadratic functions must exhibit characteristics not related to directionality. Their error stems from not recognizing parabolas as fundamental representations of quadratics regardless of orientation. This aligns most closely with confusion about the defining features of quadratic graphs rather than solely direction, but differs from related misconceptions like confusing cubics (which have inflection points) or linear graphs (which are straight lines). The student's blanket rejection suggests they failed to associate the parabolic shape itself with quadratics, not merely a specific orientation.",
