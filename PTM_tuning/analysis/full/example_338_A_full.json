  "explanation": "The correct equivalence requires multiplying numerator and denominator by 2: \\( \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{4 \\times 2}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{8}{12} \\).  \nThe student likely calculated \\( 12 \\div 6 = 2 \\) (correct scale factor), but then divided the original numerator by 2 instead of multiplying: \\( 4 \\div 2 = 2 \\).  \nThis shows they identified the scaling relationship between denominators but inverted the operation for the numerator, violating the principle of equivalent fraction scaling.  \nThe error directly stems from applying division to the numerator while correctly applying multiplication to the denominator - a mismatch in operations.  \nThis distinguishes it from merely \"forgetting to change numerators\" (they did alter it, but incorrectly) or \"not understanding equivalence\" (they recognized scaling was needed, but misapplied it).  \nThe core flaw is the failure to preserve multiplicative relationships across both terms of the fraction.",
