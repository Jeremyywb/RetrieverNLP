  "explanation": "The correct mean calculation: (1 + 4 + 7 + 9 + 9) = 30, then 30 \u00f7 5 = 6.  \nThe student's calculation: 1 + 4 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30 (no division performed).  \n\nThe error stems from treating the total sum itself as the mean, omitting division entirely. This aligns with the misconception that the mean equals the total quantity rather than requiring division by the count of values. The student likely recognized summation as part of the process but failed to apply the critical step of dividing by the number of data points (5).  \n\nThis explanation fits better than the related misconception of \"dividing by 2\" (which would yield 15) or \"dividing by the sum of categories\" (which would involve nonsensical division by 30). The absence of any division confirms the error was rooted in conflating the total with the mean itself, not misapplying an incorrect divisor.",
