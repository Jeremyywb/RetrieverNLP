  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nThe square root of a negative number has no real solution because squaring any real number yields a non-negative result. Specifically, \\( \\sqrt{-16} \\) requires complex numbers, not real numbers.\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\n\\( \\sqrt{-16} = -4 \\), likely reasoning that since \\( (-4)^2 = 16 \\), applying a negative to the root \"balances\" the negative under the radical.\n\nFlaw Explanation:\nThe student treated the negative sign under the radical as a separable component to apply to the final answer. This assumes \\( \\sqrt{-a} = -\\sqrt{a} \\), which is invalid in real numbers. The misconception conflates the square root's output sign with the input's sign.\n\nConnection to Misconception:\nThe error stems from believing the negative under the radical can be directly transferred to the answer, ignoring that squaring \\( -4 \\) produces \\( +16 \\), not \\( -16 \\). The operation \\( \\sqrt{-16} \\) inherently lacks real solutions.\n\nDistinction from Related Errors:\nThis differs from thinking square roots cannot yield negative values (e.g., \\( \\sqrt{16} \\neq -4 \\)) or that squaring preserves negativity. Here, the focus is mishandling negative inputs, not outputs.",
