  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 15 \\div 3 = 5 \\), then \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\).\n\nStudent's likely steps: \\( 15 \\div 3 = 15 \\) (incorrectly preserving the original value), then \\( 15 \\times 5 = 75 \\). However, their final answer was 15, indicating they abandoned the multiplication after the flawed division.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated division by 3 as an identity operation, retaining 15 instead of computing \\( 15 \\div 3 \\). This nullified the first step's purpose, rendering the subsequent multiplication irrelevant or unexecuted. \n\nConnection to misconception: By assuming division by 3 doesn't alter the value, they failed to reduce 15 to 5, making further calculation meaningless. This directly stems from believing division has no operational effect.\n\nDistinction: Unlike commutative errors (which would require swapped steps) or unchanged-result assumptions (which would skip both operations), this error specifically invalidates only the division step while retaining awareness of the need to process something.",
