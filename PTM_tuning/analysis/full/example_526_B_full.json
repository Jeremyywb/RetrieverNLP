  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Count all months where temperature <25\u00b0C: J(18), F(20), M(21), A(22), M(23), O(22), N(20), D(18). Total = 8.\n\nStudent's likely error: They counted only J(18), F(20), M(21), A(22), stopping after April. This ignores May (23\u00b0C) and Oct-Dec (22,20,18\u00b0C). \n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the initial rising trend (Jan-June) as a single interval and assumed temperatures remained \u226525\u00b0C after April, without verifying individual data points. This caused them to miss 4 valid months (May, Oct, Nov, Dec).\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly matches \"Only considers the first interval,\" as they failed to check later months that dip below 25\u00b0C after August's peak.\n\nDistinction from related errors: This isn't a symbol confusion (e.g., >/<) or including 25\u00b0C itself (June is excluded in the correct answer). The graph's data points were misjudged, not misread.",
