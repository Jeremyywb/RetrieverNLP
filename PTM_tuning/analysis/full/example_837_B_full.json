  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nFor \\( h(j+2) \\):\n\\( 10 \\times (4 + 2) = 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\)\n\nFor \\( h(2+j) \\):\n\\( 10 \\times (2 + 4) = 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nFirst statement: \\( 10 \\times 4 + 2 = 42 \\)\nSecond statement: \\( 10 \\times 2 + 4 = 24 \\)\n\nThe student treated \\( h(j+2) \\) as \\( h \\times j + 2 \\), ignoring the parentheses. They performed multiplication before evaluating the sum inside the brackets. This caused them to miscalculate both statements by failing to prioritize the addition operation required by the parentheses. The error directly reflects a failure to recognize that parentheses dictate the order of operations, not the default left-to-right or multiplication-first sequence. This differs from believing multiplication isn't commutative, as the error persists even when terms are reordered (\\( j+2 \\) vs. \\( 2+j \\)), showing the root issue is bracket misinterpretation, not commutativity.",
