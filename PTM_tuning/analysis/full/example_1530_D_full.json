  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\), then \\(c \\times d = cd\\), giving \\(20cd\\).\n\nIncorrect step: Student computed \\(4 + 5 = 9\\) instead of multiplying, resulting in \\(9cd\\).\n\nThe error stems from treating the coefficients as terms to be summed rather than multiplied. The student combined the numerical values additively (\\(4+5\\)) while correctly handling the variables multiplicatively (\\(c \\times d\\)). This matches the primary misconception of conflating addition with multiplication when operating on coefficients. \n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: Variables were multiplied correctly (not added as in \"adds instead of multiplies\"), and algebraic term structure was preserved, ruling out confusion about variable multiplication mechanics. The flaw is isolated to misapplying operations on numerical coefficients.",
