  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nFor Tom's rectangles: 2/4 = 1/2 and 3/9 = 1/3. Ratios differ, so not similar.\nFor Katie's rectangles: 4/7 \u2248 0.571 and 6/9 = 2/3 \u2248 0.667. Ratios differ, so not similar.\n\nStudent's Likely Calculations:\nTom: Possibly compared 2\u21924 (\u00d72) and 3\u21929 (\u00d73), assuming different scale factors are acceptable.\nKatie: May have compared 4\u21926 (\u00d71.5) and 7\u21929 (\u00d71.285), or miscalculated ratios as equal.\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nThe student treated ratios of corresponding sides as equivalent despite unequal scale factors. For Tom, they accepted \u00d72 and \u00d73 scaling as valid for similarity. For Katie, they either miscalculated ratios or accepted different scale factors.\n\nConnection to Misconception:\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of not requiring identical scale factors for all sides. The student likely reasoned that any proportional change (even inconsistent scaling) qualifies as similarity.\n\nDistinction from Related Errors:\nUnlike the \"adding same value\" misconception, the error here stems from accepting different multiplicative factors rather than additive ones. The student focused on individual side scaling rather than proportional correspondence.\n\nConclusion:\nThe core flaw was assuming similarity requires only independent scaling of sides rather than identical ratios between all corresponding dimensions.",
