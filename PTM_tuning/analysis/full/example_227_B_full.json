  "explanation": "To verify the inequality \\( d \\leq h \\), the correct calculation checks if \\( 2 \\leq -4 \\) (false) for the answer \\( d=2, h=-4 \\). The student incorrectly identified \\( d=-4, h=4 \\), where \\( -4 \\leq 4 \\) is true. \n\nThe student likely misapplied the inequality direction, treating it as \\( d \\geq h \\) instead of \\( d \\leq h \\). This would lead them to evaluate \\( -4 \\geq 4 \\) (false) and incorrectly flag the pair. \n\nThis error aligns with confusing the inequality symbol's direction, as the student reversed the comparison. It does not stem from absolute value misconceptions (since \\( -4 < 4 \\) holds regardless of magnitude) or symbol-switching rules, as no sides were swapped. The core flaw was misinterpreting the inequality's relational requirement.",
