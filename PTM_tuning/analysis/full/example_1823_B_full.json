  "explanation": "To determine perpendicularity, lines must have slopes whose product is -1. MN has slope 1, so its perpendicular should have slope -1 (KL). Vertical lines (CD) have undefined slopes, which only form right angles with horizontal lines (slope 0), not diagonal lines. \n\nThe student incorrectly assumed vertical orientation alone guarantees perpendicularity with MN's diagonal path. This conflates geometric orientation with slope relationships. While CD is vertical, perpendicularity to MN requires slope -1 - not verticality. This distinguishes from sign-flipping errors (which would yield slope -1.25 for GH, not CD's vertical line). The error stems from equating cardinal directions with perpendicular relationships regardless of slope mathematics.",
