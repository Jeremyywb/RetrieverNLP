  "explanation": "The correct approach calculates consecutive triangle numbers by incrementing the added term: \\(171 - 153 = 18\\), so the next term adds \\(19\\), yielding \\(171 + 19 = 190\\).\n\nThe student likely added \\(153 + 171 = 324\\), assuming the next term equals the sum of the two previous terms. This stems from misapplying a Fibonacci-style addition rule instead of recognizing triangle numbers grow by sequentially increasing integers. \n\nThe error occurs because they treated the sequence as requiring pairwise addition (like the Fibonacci sequence) rather than incremental step increases (+18, +19, +20...). This directly matches the misconception of applying arithmetic sequence rules to non-arithmetic patterns. \n\nIt differs from the \"same difference\" misconception because the student didn't assume a constant difference (e.g., repeating +18) but instead introduced a different invalid operation (summing terms). The error is uniquely tied to inventing a new pattern rule unrelated to triangle number definitions.",
