  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Movement vectors: PQ = (4,1), QR = (8,2) = 2*(4,1)\n2. Total displacement PR = PQ + QR = 3*(4,1)\n3. Ratios of magnitudes: |PQ| : |PR| = 1 : 3\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n1. Likely compared PQ (1 unit scaled) to QR (2 units scaled)\n2. Resulted in ratio 1:2 instead of 1:3\n\nSpecific reasoning flaw:\nThe student treated PQ and QR as separate ratio components (1:2) rather than recognizing PR as the combined length containing 3 equal PQ segments. This shows a failure to identify the total length PR as the comparison target, instead creating a part-to-part ratio between consecutive segments.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nBy focusing on adjacent segments PQ:QR rather than PQ:PR, the student incorrectly applied ratio relationships between components of the whole rather than between a component and its cumulative sum.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis isn't about misapplying proportionality or scaling factors (which were correctly identified in QR being twice PQ), but specifically about selecting the wrong comparison terms for the ratio.\n\nMathematical basis:\nRatios require explicit identification of compared quantities. The error stems from comparing components (PQ vs QR) instead of component vs aggregate (PQ vs PR).",
