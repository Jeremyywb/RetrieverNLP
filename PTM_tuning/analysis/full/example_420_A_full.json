  "explanation": "To identify the outlier, convert all values to decimals: 0.8, 0.82, 0.35, 0.77, 0.8, 0.79. The correct outlier is 0.35 (7/20), as it lies significantly below the cluster of values between 0.77-0.82. \n\nThe student selected 0.82 (41/50) instead. Their error stems from comparing fraction forms without calculating decimal equivalents. They likely saw 41/50 as distinct due to its larger numerator compared to other fractions (e.g., 8/10=40/50), falsely interpreting numerator size as indicating deviation. \n\nThis reflects a failure to recognize outliers require analyzing numerical spread, not component parts of fractions. The misconception differs from denominator-focused errors (e.g., 41/50's denominator isn't largest) and ordering mistakes, as the true outlier's decimal value is visibly distinct once converted.",
