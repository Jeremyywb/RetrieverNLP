  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Square side = \u221a196 = 14 cm\n2. Compound perimeter = (3 square sides + 4 pentagon sides) \u00d7 14\n3. Total = 7 \u00d7 14 = 98 cm\n\nStudent's error:\n1. Treated area (196 cm\u00b2) as perimeter: 196 \u00f7 4 = 49 cm/side\n2. Multiplied by 7 sides: 7 \u00d7 49 = 343 cm\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student incorrectly used the square's area value to calculate side length for perimeter determination. By dividing 196 (area) by 4 (sides), they mistakenly derived a 49 cm side length instead of using \u221a196=14 cm. This confusion between area and measurement dimensions caused all subsequent calculations to scale incorrectly by a factor of \u221a196/4=3.5.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis isn't simple addition vs multiplication - the core error stems from misapplying area formulas to perimeter calculation. The student correctly counted visible sides (7) but corrupted the base measurement through initial dimensional confusion.",
