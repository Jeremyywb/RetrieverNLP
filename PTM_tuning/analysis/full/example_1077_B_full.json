  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. For region A: \\( x + 5.3 \\leq 0 \\Rightarrow x \\leq -5.3 \\)\n2. For region C: \\( -\\frac{5.3+x}{2} > 0 \\Rightarrow 5.3+x < 0 \\Rightarrow x < -5.3 \\)\nAt \\( x = -5.3 \\):\n- First inequality holds (equality)\n- Second inequality fails (0 \u226f 0)\n\nStudent's error:\nThey concluded \\( x = -5.3 \\) satisfies both inequalities. This implies they likely:\n1. Correctly identified \\( x \\leq -5.3 \\) for region A\n2. Mistakenly treated the second inequality's solution as \\( x \\leq -5.3 \\) instead of \\( x < -5.3 \\)\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student treated the second inequality's strict inequality \\( x < -5.3 \\) as non-strict \\( x \\leq -5.3 \\). This stems from misapplying inequality properties when multiplying/dividing by negatives, specifically failing to recognize that \\( -\\frac{5.3+x}{2} > 0 \\) excludes equality (0 \u226f 0).\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThe error aligns with confusing inequality strictness after transformations, not with switching inequality sides or misreading symbols. The exclusion of equality in strict inequalities was overlooked, distinguishing it from general symbol confusion.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nUnlike absolute value comparisons or sign-switching errors, this specifically involves mishandling strict vs. non-strict inequalities after algebraic manipulation.",
