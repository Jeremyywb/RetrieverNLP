  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Start with \\(-\\frac{1}{3}y \\leq -6\\)\n2. Multiply both sides by \\(-3\\) (reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\)):\n   \\[\n   (-3)(-\\frac{1}{3}y) \\geq (-3)(-6) \\quad \\text{(inequality flips)}\n   \\]\n3. Result: \\(y \\geq 18\\)\n\nStudent's likely steps:\n1. Treated \\(-\\frac{1}{3}y \\leq -6\\) as requiring division by 3 instead of multiplying by \\(-3\\)\n2. Divided both sides by 3: \\(-\\frac{1}{3}y \u00f7 3 \\leq -6 \u00f7 3\\)\n3. Simplified to \\(-\\frac{1}{9}y \\leq -2\\), then multiplied by \\(-9\\) (flipping sign again): \\(y \\geq 2\\)\n\nKey flaw: The student divided by the denominator 3 instead of multiplying by the reciprocal \\(-3\\). This caused two errors: (1) incorrect coefficient transformation (dividing by 3 instead of multiplying by \\(-3\\)) and (2) unnecessary second sign flip when multiplying by \\(-9\\). The core issue was mishandling fraction division as simple division by the denominator rather than reciprocal multiplication.\n\nDistinction: Unlike general inverse operation errors, this specifically shows failure to use the reciprocal when eliminating a fractional coefficient. The student incorrectly interpreted division by a fraction as division by its denominator alone, not multiplication by its reciprocal.",
