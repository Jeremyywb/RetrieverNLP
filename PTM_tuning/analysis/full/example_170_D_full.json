  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Starting from 3rd term (8), apply \"-2\" four times to reach 7th term:\n  8 (term3) \u2192 6 (term4) \u2192 4 (term5) \u2192 2 (term6) \u2192 0 (term7)\n\nStudent's error:\n- Calculated only one application: 8 - 2 = 6\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student applied the term-to-term rule once to the given 3rd term, producing the 4th term (6). They treated the 7th term request as requiring only the next term after the 3rd, rather than recognizing it requires four iterations of the rule. This matches the misconception of providing the next term instead of the specified term. \n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis isn't misapplying the rule to position numbers (which would yield different values) or giving a prior term. The error specifically involves stopping at the immediate next term rather than continuing to the requested term.",
