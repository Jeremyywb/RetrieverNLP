  "explanation": "To find a common multiple of 4, 6, and 12, the correct approach calculates their least common multiple (LCM). Since 12 is already a multiple of both 4 and 6, the LCM is 12. A common multiple must satisfy divisibility by all three numbers: \\(12 \\div 4 = 3\\), \\(12 \\div 6 = 2\\), and \\(12 \\div 12 = 1\\), confirming 12 works.\n\nThe student selected 20, which fails divisibility tests: \\(20 \\div 6 \\approx 3.33\\) (not an integer). The error stems from assuming multiples of 4 automatically qualify as multiples of 12 (a multiple of 4) and 6. For example, the student reasoned that because 20 is a multiple of 4, it must also be a multiple of 12 and its factors (like 6). This directly aligns with the misconception that multiples of a number's factors inherit divisibility by the original number. \n\nThis differs from related errors like adding numbers to find LCM (20 is not the sum of 4, 6, or 12) or focusing on only two numbers (20 isn\u2019t a multiple of 6 or 12). The flaw lies in incorrectly assuming hierarchical divisibility rather than verifying actual divisibility rules for all three numbers.",
