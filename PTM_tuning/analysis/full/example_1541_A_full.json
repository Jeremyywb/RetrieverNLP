  "explanation": "The correct solution requires the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac = 0 \\) to produce one solution. For the student's answer \\( \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{11}}{5} \\), the discriminant is \\( 11 \\), not \\( 0 \\). \n\nThe student likely calculated the discriminant correctly but failed to recognize that only a discriminant of \\( 0 \\) yields one solution. Their choice of \\( \\sqrt{11} \\) suggests they incorrectly associated \"exactly one solution\" with a non-zero discriminant, possibly believing a zero discriminant was invalid or equivalent to no solution. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception that \\( 0 \\) is not a valid solution, as they avoided \\( \\sqrt{0} \\) despite it being mathematically valid. It is distinct from other listed misconceptions, as the error stems from rejecting \\( 0 \\), not confusion about square roots of negatives or computational errors in calculating the discriminant itself.",
