  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nMidpoint formula: \\( \\frac{1 + x_2}{2} = -1 \\) and \\( \\frac{7 + y_2}{2} = 0.5 \\).\nFor y-coordinate: \\( 7 + y_2 = 1 \\) (multiplying both sides by 2), then \\( y_2 = 1 - 7 = -6 \\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nThey likely wrote \\( 7 + y_2 = 0.5 \\) (omitting division by 2), leading to \\( y_2 = 0.5 - 7 = -6.5 \\).\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student failed to multiply the midpoint's y-coordinate by 2 before subtracting the known endpoint's y-value. This skipped the critical step of reversing the midpoint formula's division-by-2 operation.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThis directly matches \"Does not divide by 2 when finding midpoint\" - in reverse application. The student treated the midpoint as a sum rather than an average, ignoring the required scaling to recover the original sum.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike subtraction errors or coordinate pair differences, this specifically stems from mishandling the midpoint formula's division by 2 when working backward to find an endpoint.\n\nNon-repetitive focus:\nThe error occurred exclusively in the algebraic reversal of the midpoint formula for the y-coordinate, not in arithmetic operations or sign management.",
