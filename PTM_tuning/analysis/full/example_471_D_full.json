  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (\u00a373 + 2\u00d7\u00a341) - \u00a340 = (\u00a373+\u00a382) - \u00a340 = \u00a3155 - \u00a340 = \u00a3115.\n\nStudent's error: \u00a373 + \u00a341 + \u00a341 + \u00a340 = \u00a3195.\n\nThe student incorrectly treated the \u00a340 gift voucher as an expense to be added to purchases, rather than a payment to subtract. This shows a failure to distinguish between costs (positive values) and payments (negative values). By adding all numerical values present in the problem - dress, two shoes, and voucher - they committed a role misinterpretation error. This differs from simple \"add all numbers\" errors because it specifically conflates opposing financial roles (cost vs credit), not just mathematical operations. The related \"adds all numbers\" misconception applies here, but the critical flaw is misinterpreting the voucher's function as a cost rather than a deduction.",
