  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \nSum of interior angles = \\((8-2) \\times 180 = 1080^\\degree\\). \nEach angle = \\(1080 \\div 8 = 135^\\degree\\).\n\nStudent's likely error: \nComputed the sum correctly as \\(1080^\\degree\\), then divided by \\(8-2=6\\) instead of \\(8\\): \n\\(1080 \\div 6 = 180^\\degree\\).\n\nSpecific flaw: \nThe student divided the total sum by the number of triangles (\\(n-2\\)) instead of the number of sides (\\(n\\)) when calculating individual angles. This stems from conflating the formula's partitioning step (sum divided by sides) with the triangle-counting step (\\(n-2\\) triangles). \n\nDistinction: \nThis differs from multiplying \\(n \\times 180\\) for the sum (which would also yield \\(180^\\degree\\) if divided by \\(n\\)), as the error here occurs strictly in the division step after correctly calculating the sum. Other listed misconceptions produce different numerical results or apply unrelated formulas.",
