  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Perform multiplication: \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\)\n2. Then evaluate left to right: \\(3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6\\)\n\nStudent's likely steps:\n1. Added \\(5 + 4 = 9\\) first (ignoring multiplication priority)\n2. Multiplied \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\)\n3. Subtracted from 3: \\(3 - 18 = -12\\)\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student prioritized addition over multiplication, incorrectly grouping \\(5 + 4\\) before addressing \\(4 \\times 2\\). This directly reflects performing addition ahead of multiplication, as they altered the operation order by resolving addition prematurely. \n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nUnlike subtraction commutativity errors (which would involve rearranging terms like \\(5 - 3\\)), this error specifically stems from misordering operations, not misapplying subtraction properties. The student's grouping of additions before multiplicative terms aligns precisely with the misconception of elevating addition above multiplication.",
