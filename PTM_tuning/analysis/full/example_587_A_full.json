  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Problem P: \\(6 \\div 3 = 2\\) first, then \\(2 + 5\\)\n- Problem Q: \\(6 \\div 3 = 2\\) first, then \\(2 \\times 5\\)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculations:\n- Problem P: \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) first, then \\(6 \\div 8\\)\n- Problem Q: \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) first, then \\(6 \\div 15\\)\n\nThe student incorrectly prioritized addition in Problem P and multiplication in Problem Q over division, despite division appearing first in the left-to-right sequence. This shows they treated all operations as requiring explicit priority comparisons rather than recognizing that division/multiplication (and addition/subtraction) share equal priority and must be resolved left-to-right. The error stems from not processing same-priority operations sequentially, leading them to select the rightmost operation instead of the leftmost one in both cases. This distinguishes it from strict BIDMAS misapplication (which would still do division first in Q) or complete disregard for priorities (which would calculate all operations equally). The core flaw is misapplying priority equality rules for same-level operations.",
