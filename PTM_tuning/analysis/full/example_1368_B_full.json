  "explanation": "The correct solution identifies both \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\) as values where \\( y = 1 \\), based on the graph intersecting \\( y=1 \\) at these points. \n\nThe student likely observed the graph crossing \\( y=1 \\) at \\( x=2 \\) but failed to recognize the corresponding point at \\( x=-2 \\). This indicates they assumed solutions must be positive, overlooking the symmetry at \\( y=1 \\). \n\nThe error stems from the misconception that only positive roots are valid. While the graph is not fully symmetrical (e.g., it extends further to the right at \\( x=4 \\)), the points \\( (-2,1) \\) and \\( (2,1) \\) are symmetrical. The student ignored the negative solution despite this local symmetry, unlike cases where asymmetry invalidates equal absolute values. This distinguishes the error from misconceptions about symmetry, as the solutions here do share the same absolute value.",
