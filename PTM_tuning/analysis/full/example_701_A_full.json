  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes each column in the original pattern contributes 3 squares. For Pattern 100, there are 100 columns (from \\(3n + 2 = 302\\)), so modifying each column to have 2 squares instead of 3 yields \\(2 \\times 100 + 2 = 202\\).\n\nThe student likely subtracted 1 directly from 302, arriving at 301. This error stems from misinterpreting the structural change as removing one total square rather than one square per column. \n\nThe flaw occurred by treating the modification as a single subtraction operation for the entire pattern instead of recognizing the per-column reduction. This aligns with confusing the geometric pattern's multiplicative change with a simple arithmetic sequence adjustment. \n\nThe related misconception of \"assumes a sequence is linear\" doesn't apply here, as the student didn't incorrectly model growth rate but instead misapplied the modification's scope. The error specifically stems from failing to recognize how the removal operation scales with the number of columns.",
