  "explanation": "To determine rotational symmetry order, calculate how many distinct positions match the original during a full 360\u00b0 rotation. A rectangle aligns at 180\u00b0 and 360\u00b0, giving order 2. A square aligns at 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0, and 360\u00b0, resulting in order 4.\n\nThe student incorrectly associated rotational symmetry order with equal side lengths rather than alignment during rotation. They likely assumed the square's four equal sides directly correspond to rotational symmetry order 2, neglecting to verify how many rotational positions actually align. \n\nThis error stems from conflating side-length equality with rotational alignment requirements. The student fixated on the square's equal sides as a defining feature for symmetry order, bypassing the critical step of testing rotational increments. \n\nThis misconception differs from confusing rotational symmetry with reflection symmetry or miscounting alignment positions, as it directly ties symmetry order to side-length equality instead of geometric congruence during rotation.",
