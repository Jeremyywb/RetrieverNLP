  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the formula \\( \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\), yielding \\( 6 \\, \\mathrm{m/s} \\times 10 \\, \\mathrm{s} = 60 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\). \n\nThe student likely interpreted the given speed \\( 6 \\, \\mathrm{m/s} \\) as the final displacement value at \\( t = 10 \\, \\mathrm{s} \\), directly equating the speed to the graph's y-coordinate (the star) instead of recognizing that speed corresponds to the graph's gradient. \n\nThe flaw stems from conflating the physical meaning of speed (a rate of change, tied to the slope of the displacement-time graph) with the literal y-axis value (total displacement/distance). This caused them to incorrectly assign \\( 6 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\) as the answer instead of computing the product of speed and time. \n\nThe error aligns with misinterpreting the graph's gradient as a static value rather than a derived quantity. It is distinct from scale misinterpretations (e.g., misreading axes or squares), as the error persists even with correctly labeled axes.",
