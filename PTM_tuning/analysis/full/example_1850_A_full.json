  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 15 m/s \u00d7 10 s = 150 m. The graph's slope represents velocity, so the vertical intercept (star) equals total displacement.\n\nStudent's error:  \nAssuming each horizontal axis division (2 seconds) applies to vertical scaling. Calculated 3 vertical squares \u00d7 2 m/square = 6 m.\n\nFlawed reasoning:  \nThe student incorrectly mapped the horizontal scale (2 seconds/division) to the vertical axis. They treated both axes as having identical scaling (2 units/square), multiplying 3 squares by 2 m/square.\n\nConnection to misconception:  \nThis assumes axes scales must align with grid squares, ignoring that vertical and horizontal scales are independent. The error stems from forcing consistency between axes instead of using the given speed-time relationship.\n\nDistinction:  \nUnlike \"reading the other axis,\" the student correctly identified the star's vertical position but misapplied scaling rules. The error isn't about misreading axes labels but misinterpreting how scales relate to grid divisions.",
