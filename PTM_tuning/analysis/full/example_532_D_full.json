  "explanation": "To find the fourth vertex, we calculate midpoints of diagonals. The midpoint between (0,3) and (4,-1) is ((0+4)/2, (3+(-1))/2) = (2,1). The missing diagonal's midpoint must also be (2,1). For point (2,-3) and unknown (x,y), midpoint ((2+x)/2, (-3+y)/2) = (2,1). Solving: 2+x=4 \u2192 x=2, and -3+y=2 \u2192 y=5 (incorrect pairing). Correct pairing: midpoint between (0,3) and (2,-3) is (1,0). The other diagonal (4,-1) and (x,y) must also have midpoint (1,0): (4+x)/2=1 \u2192 x=-2, (-1+y)/2=0 \u2192 y=1.\n\nThe student likely calculated horizontal displacement only: (0,3) to (4,-1) has \u0394x=4. Assuming equal horizontal movement from (2,-3), they subtracted 4 from x=2 to get x=-2, keeping y=-3 fixed. This ignores vertical balance required by rectangle diagonals.\n\nThe error stems from isolating x-coordinate relationships without maintaining midpoint consistency across both coordinates. This matches \"Focuses on the difference between x-coordinates only\" - they replicated horizontal spacing but didn't verify midpoint alignment or vertical coordinate parity. It's distinct from general length miscalculations or rectangle property ignorance, as they partially recognized horizontal patterns but failed to integrate vertical constraints.",
