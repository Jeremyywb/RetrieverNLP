  "explanation": "The correct calculation is \\( 4^{2} = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\).  \nThe student likely calculated \\( 4^{2} \\) as \\( 4 \\) itself, treating the exponent as irrelevant.  \nThe error stems from misinterpreting the exponent notation as a label rather than an operation.  \nBy failing to recognize that the superscript \"2\" requires multiplying the base by itself, the student preserved the original number instead of performing squaring.  \nThis directly aligns with ignoring the exponent's operational role, not confusion about digit repetition (e.g., writing \"44\") or arithmetic errors in multiplication.  \nThe error is distinct from simply not knowing square numbers, as the core issue is disregarding the notation's meaning entirely.",
