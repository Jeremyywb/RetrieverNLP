  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 0.15 \\times 100 = 15\\% \\).\n\nStudent's error: Likely calculated \\( 0.15 \\times 10 = 1.5\\% \\), shifting the decimal one place instead of two.\n\nThe flaw stems from treating the decimal as representing tenths rather than hundredths. Since 0.15 has two decimal places, converting to a percentage requires multiplying by 100 (moving two positions). The student's single decimal shift (equivalent to multiplying by 10) caused them to interpret 0.15 as 1.5% instead of 15%.\n\nThis matches the primary misconception of underestimating decimal shifts, not confusion between tenths/hundredths (which would involve misnaming place values) or multiplying by 1000 (which creates larger errors). The error specifically aligns with miscalculating the scale factor needed for percentage conversion.",
