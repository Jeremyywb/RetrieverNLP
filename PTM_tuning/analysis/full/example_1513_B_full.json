  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Convert fractions to common denominators (40):\n2/5 = 16/40, 3/8 = 15/40, 13/40 remains. Chocolate (16/40) is largest.\n\nStudent's error: Comparing denominators 5 and 8 directly, concluding 3/8 (vanilla) > 2/5 (chocolate) because 8 > 5. \n\nFlaw: Ordered fractions by comparing denominators alone without equivalent conversion. The student treated denominator size as the sole comparison factor, ignoring that numerator scaling affects value. This aligns with \"ordered fractions by comparing denominators rather than using equivalent fractions\" since they didn't convert fractions to equivalent forms with matching denominators to compare numerators properly.\n\nDistinction: Unlike the unit fraction misconception (where larger denominator = smaller fraction), here the student applied denominator comparison to non-unit fractions, assuming larger denominators implied larger fractions despite differing numerators. This specific error stems from prioritizing denominator size over equivalent value comparison.",
