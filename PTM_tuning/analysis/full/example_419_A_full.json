  "explanation": "The correct reasoning recognizes that a uniform rectangular cross-section indicates a prism whose base matches that cross-section, making the 3D shape a cuboid. The student incorrectly identified the shape as \"rectangle,\" a 2D term. \n\nThe error stems from conflating the cross-sectional shape (a 2D face) with the entire 3D object. The student treated the cross-sectional rectangle as synonymous with the solid itself, rather than understanding that extruding a rectangle perpendicular to its plane creates a cuboid. \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of naming a face instead of the 3D shape. The student did not apply the definition of a prism (a 3D figure with identical cross-sections along its length). Related misconceptions like confusion about prism definitions or cross-section flexibility are less applicable here, as the error specifically substitutes a 2D term for the required 3D one.",
