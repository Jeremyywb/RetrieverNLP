  "explanation": "The correct calculation substitutes n=1 into 5n-7: 5(1)-7 = -2.  \nThe student's answer (-7) matches substituting n=0: 5(0)-7 = -7.  \nThe error stems from treating n=0 as the starting index instead of n=1.  \nThis directly aligns with the misconception that sequences begin at n=0, causing the student to reduce n by 1 for all terms.  \nThis differs from \"disregarding the coefficient\" errors, which would manifest as 1\u00d75-7 (incorrectly applying n=1 but omitting multiplication) rather than n=0 substitution.  \nThe precise mismatch between term position and index value explains the specific error better than general substitution oversight.",
