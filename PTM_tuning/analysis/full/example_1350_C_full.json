  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(40 \\times 7 = 280\\), multiplying the full values from each grid header.  \nStudent's error: Calculated \\(4 \\times 7 = 28\\), treating \"40\" as a single digit 4.  \nFlaw: The student multiplied the digits 4 and 7 in isolation, disregarding the place value of \"40\" (which represents 4 tens).  \nConnection: This reflects a failure to recognize that grid headers represent decomposed values (e.g., 40 is not 4 units but 4 tens), leading to digit-wise multiplication.  \nDistinction: The error isn't addition or incomplete multiplication but a place-value misinterpretation, as the operation itself was multiplication of digits, not sums.",
