  "explanation": "The correct analysis recognizes that Katie's expression \\( 3 - \\frac{n}{3} \\) simplifies to \\( -\\frac{1}{3}n + 3 \\), which is linear (degree 1), while Tom's \\( (n+1)^3 \\) expands to a cubic polynomial (degree 3). The student likely rejected Katie's expression because it was not in the explicit \"an + b\" form with the \\(n\\)-term first. For example, they might have interpreted \\( 3 - \\frac{n}{3} \\) as non-linear due to the subtraction or the fractional coefficient, failing to see it algebraically rearranges to standard linear form. This aligns with the misconception that linear rules must strictly match \\( an + b \\) formatting, rather than understanding linearity depends solely on the degree of \\(n\\). The error is distinct from the related misconception about negative gradients, as the student rejected a valid linear expression regardless of its slope sign.",
