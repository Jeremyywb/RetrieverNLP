  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 58.2684 rounded to 1 decimal place requires examining the second decimal (6). Since 6 \u2265 5, the first decimal (2) increases by 1: 58.2 \u2192 58.3.\n\nStudent's error: They produced 59.3. This indicates they added 1 to both the units digit (8 \u2192 9) and tenths digit (2 \u2192 3).\n\nReasoning flaw: The student treated the 0.1 increment required for rounding the tenths place as a full 1.0 increment to the entire number. This caused an erroneous carry-over to the units place, doubling the required adjustment.\n\nMisconception link: Overcompensation in rounding led to conflating tenths-place rounding (which affects only 0.1) with whole-number rounding (which affects 1.0).\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"rounds too much\" (which would involve multiple decimal places) or \"wrong place value\" (which would misidentify the rounding digit). The error specifically stems from miscalculating the magnitude of the adjustment required.",
