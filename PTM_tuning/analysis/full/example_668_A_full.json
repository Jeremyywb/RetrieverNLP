  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Identify all values with the highest frequency. Both 0 and 2 occur twice (max frequency). Since no single value occurs more frequently than others, there's no mode.\n\nStudent's error: Listed 0 and 2 as modes, treating tied frequencies as valid modes.\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student recognized the highest frequency but incorrectly assumed multiple values can simultaneously satisfy the mode requirement. They treated \"most frequent\" as a category to list rather than requiring a unique maximum.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error stems from misunderstanding that mode requires one value to strictly exceed others' frequencies. The student didn't recognize equal frequencies negate mode existence.\n\nDistinction from related: This differs from thinking tied frequencies automatically mean no mode (which would align with the correct answer). Here, the student actively misapplied the definition by accepting multiple modes when the problem's context rejects them.\n\nFinal verification: The error matches a fundamental misdefinition of mode rather than confusion about frequency comparisons or median calculations.",
