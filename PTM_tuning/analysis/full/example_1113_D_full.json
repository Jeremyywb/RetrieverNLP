  "explanation": "The correct calculation follows the rule that dividing two negative numbers yields a positive result: \\( (-3) \\div (-5) = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \\). \n\nThe student incorrectly calculated \\( (-3) \\div (-5) = -0.6 \\), applying a negative sign to the quotient despite both numbers being negative. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the sign rules for division: the student assumed the result of dividing two negatives must be negative. This directly aligns with the misconception that multiplying/dividing two negatives yields a negative answer. \n\nThe student likely reasoned that \"negative divided by negative equals negative,\" overriding the correct rule. This distinguishes from related misconceptions like misinterpreting operator precedence (e.g., viewing \"\\(-\\)\" as subtraction) or commutativity errors, which do not involve sign determination. \n\nThe flaw is isolated to sign handling, not calculation of the numerical value (0.6 vs. -0.6), confirming the focus on negative/number division rules.",
