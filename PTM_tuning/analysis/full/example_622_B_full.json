  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{12}\\) (finding 1/3 of the 1/4 green section)\nStudent's calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\div \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{4}\\) (incorrect operation)\n\nThe error occurs at the conceptual step where fractions of sections must be calculated. The student misapplied division when the problem requires finding a fraction (1/3) of an existing fraction (1/4). This stems from confusing the operation needed to partition a section into equal parts - division is required to split a whole into parts, but multiplication is needed to find a fraction of an existing fraction. The misconception specifically manifests as substituting division for multiplication when handling fractional subdivisions, distinct from procedural errors in fraction division methods. This error pattern matches the primary misconception better than general confusion about division/multiplication procedures, as it directly concerns the relationship between subdivision operations and their mathematical representations.",
