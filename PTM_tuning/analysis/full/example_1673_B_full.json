  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 1 favorable outcome (3) out of 5 total sectors \u2192 1/5 = 20%.\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: Likely treated the 4 distinct numbers (1,2,3,4) as the total outcomes, calculating 1/4 = 25%.\n\nFlaw: The student incorrectly assumed the total possible outcomes equal the number of unique labels (4), ignoring the duplicate \"1\" sector. This reflects a failure to recognize that probability depends on the count of physical sectors, not distinct labels. \n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly stems from treating labels as equal-probability categories rather than counting individual sectors. The student conflated \"distinct outcomes\" with \"distinct labels,\" altering the denominator.\n\nDistinction: This isn't a fraction-to-percentage conversion error (they correctly converted 1/4 to 25%) or using the outcome as the numerator (they correctly counted one \"3\"). The error specifically resides in misidentifying the total outcomes.",
