  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(47^2 = 47 \\times 47 = 2209\\).  \nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\(47 \\div 2 = 23.5\\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly substituted squaring with division by 2, treating the exponent as an instruction to halve rather than multiply the number by itself. This stems from conflating the operation of squaring (raising to the second power) with the unrelated action of halving, misinterpreting the mathematical meaning of the exponent.  \n\nThe error aligns with confusing squaring with halving, as the student directly replaced the required multiplication with division by 2. This is distinct from confusing squaring with doubling (which would yield \\(47 \\times 2\\)) or misapplying square roots, as the problem explicitly involved squaring, not root extraction. The core flaw is misassociating the exponent notation with division rather than repeated multiplication.",
