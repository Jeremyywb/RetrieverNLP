  "explanation": "Correct calculation for (3,-1): \n\\(3^2 + (-1)^2 = 9 + 1 = 10\\).\n\nStudent's calculation for (-9,1): \n\\((-9)^2 + 1^2 = 81 + 1 = 82 \\neq 10\\).\n\nThe student incorrectly assumed coordinates with absolute values larger than \\(\\sqrt{10}\\) could satisfy \\(x^2 + y^2 = 10\\). They likely treated the radius as \\(10\\) instead of \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), misinterpreting the equation's constant term as the radius itself rather than its square. This caused them to accept values like \\(-9\\) (since \\(|-9| < 10\\)) despite exceeding the true radius. \n\nThis directly aligns with confusing the radius with the radius squared, not with arithmetic errors or sign misconceptions. Unlike related misconceptions (e.g., squaring negatives incorrectly), their error stems from misidentifying the geometric meaning of the equation's constant term.",
