  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(15 \\times 42 = 15 \\times (40 + 2) = 600 + 30 = 630\\). Katie's method computes \\(15 \\times 4 + 15 \\times 2 = 60 + 30 = 90\\), while Tom's \\(154 \\times 2 = 308\\) also fails.\n\nThe student likely recognized Katie used the distributive property but failed to notice she split 42 as \\(4 + 2\\) instead of \\(40 + 2\\). This caused the student to incorrectly validate Katie's answer despite her using 4 (units place) rather than 40 (tens place). \n\nThe flaw stems from misapplying the distributive property by decomposing the number into digits rather than place values. This directly aligns with the misconception about splitting multiplication via distribution without maintaining the original quantity's magnitude. \n\nThis differs from related misconceptions: Tom's error involves invalid factor manipulation (not commutative property), while Katie's is purely a distributive decomposition error (not bracket insertion or compensation strategy).",
