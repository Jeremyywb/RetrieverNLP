  "explanation": "The correct transformation replaces \\( y \\) with \\( -y \\), yielding \\( -y = 3x - 7 \\) \u2192 \\( y = -3x + 7 \\), matching the target equation. \n\nThe student likely reasoned: \"Reflecting over the \\( y \\)-axis replaces \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\),\" applying it to \\( y = 3x - 7 \\) to get \\( y = 3(-x) - 7 = -3x - 7 \\). This incorrectly retains the original constant term \\(-7\\) instead of \\(+7\\), showing they conflated negating \\( x \\) (y-axis reflection) with negating the entire expression (x-axis reflection). \n\nThe flaw stems from misattributing the sign change of \\( 3x \\) to \\( x \\)-replacement (y-axis) rather than recognizing the negation of \\( y \\)-values (x-axis). This aligns with confusing which reflection corresponds to \\( y = -f(x) \\) vs. \\( y = f(-x) \\). \n\nThe related misconception \"Thinks \\( y = ? \\) is the x-axis\" does not apply here, as the student correctly associated axis reflections but misapplied their algebraic effects.",
