  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nLet T = tea price, C = coffee price\n1) 5T + 2C = 3.70\n2) 2T + 5C = 4.00\nMultiply equation 1 by 5: 25T + 10C = 18.50\nMultiply equation 2 by 2: 4T + 10C = 8.00\nSubtract: 21T = 10.50 \u2192 T = 0.50\nSubstitute T=0.50 into equation 1: 5(0.50) + 2C = 3.70 \u2192 2C = 1.20 \u2192 C=0.60\n\nStudent's error:\nThe student wrote the correct numerical values (T=0.50, C=0.60) but likely failed to connect both equations mathematically. Their solution matches the answer but shows no evidence of elimination/substitution steps required for simultaneous equations.\n\nFlawed reasoning:\nThe student appears to have guessed values satisfying one equation (e.g., 5*0.50 + 2*0.60 = 3.70) without verifying they also satisfy the second equation (2*0.50 + 5*0.60 = 4.00). This suggests they treated the equations as separate constraints rather than interdependent relationships.\n\nMisconception link:\nThe correct values coincidentally satisfy both equations, masking the error. This indicates the student didn't systematically solve the system but potentially guessed values that worked for the first equation, then stopped.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis differs from \"ignoring variables\" (they included both) or \"incomplete calculations\" (they produced final answers). The core issue is treating equations as isolated rather than interdependent.\n\nVerification gap:\nWhile their answers happen to be correct, the lack of demonstrated cross-validation suggests they didn't grasp that both equations must be actively used in the solving process.",
