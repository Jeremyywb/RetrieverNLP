  "explanation": "The correct factorization uses the difference of squares: \\( 9x^2 - 16 = (3x)^2 - 4^2 = (3x+4)(3x-4) \\). \n\nThe student incorrectly wrote \\( 9x(x - 16) \\), which implies they treated the expression as \\( 9x \\cdot x - 16 \\) (factoring only \\( 9x \\)) instead of recognizing the quadratic structure. \n\nThe error stems from misidentifying common factors: the student isolated \\( 9x \\) from \\( 9x^2 \\), then directly appended \\( -16 \\) without adjusting for the factored-out term. This violates the requirement that factoring \\( 9x \\) would demand \\( 16 \\) to be divided by \\( 9x \\), which is impossible here. \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of only factoring the first term and incorrectly handling the constant term, rather than recognizing the expression as a difference of squares. It is distinct from errors like misapplying single-bracket subtraction rules, as the student did not attempt to adjust the constant term proportionally (e.g., writing \\( 9x(x - \\frac{16}{9}) \\), which would still be incorrect but show awareness of factoring mechanics).",
