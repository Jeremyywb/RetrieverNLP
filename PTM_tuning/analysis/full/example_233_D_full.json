  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{2}{ab + 3} \\)\nStudent's calculation: \\( \\frac{2}{a \\times b + 3} \\)\n\nThe student correctly preserved the order of operations (division first, then addition and multiplication) but added an explicit multiplication symbol between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) instead of using algebraic notation. This reflects a misunderstanding of the convention that adjacent variables imply multiplication. The explicit \"\u00d7\" is redundant here, as \\(ab\\) already denotes \\(a \\times b\\) in standard algebraic form. The error stems from treating variables as requiring explicit operators for multiplication, unlike the related misconceptions about operation priority or bracket handling, which would alter the mathematical structure. The answer's equivalence (mathematically) but non-standard form confirms this specific notation misconception.",
