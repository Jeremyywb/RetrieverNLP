  "explanation": "**Correct Calculation:**\n1. Factor numerator: \\( t^2 + 2t + 1 = (t+1)^2 \\)\n2. Simplify: \\( \\frac{(t+1)^2}{t+1} = t+1 \\)\n\n**Student's Error:**\nThe student did not factor the numerator and concluded no simplification exists.\n\n**Flawed Reasoning:**\nThe student failed to recognize \\( t^2 + 2t + 1 \\) as a perfect square trinomial. Without identifying this structure, they treated the numerator as irreducible, preventing cancellation with the denominator \\( t+1 \\).\n\n**Connection to Misconception:**\nThis directly stems from an inability to detect the \\( a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\) pattern. The error occurs at the initial factoring step, where pattern recognition is critical.\n\n**Distinction from Related Misconceptions:**\nThis differs from general fraction simplification errors, as the student would need to first identify the common factor through factoring. The error is rooted in pattern recognition, not algebraic mechanics like incorrect cancellation or faulty factoring attempts.",
