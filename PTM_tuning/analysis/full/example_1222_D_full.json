  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(70.04 \\div 0.1 = 70.04 \\times 10 = 700.4\\) (dividing by 0.1 is equivalent to multiplying by 10).\n\nStudent's error: They likely performed \\(70.04 \\div 10 = 7.004\\), reversing the required operation. \n\nThe flaw stems from treating division by 0.1 as division by its reciprocal (10) instead of multiplication. This misapplication directly converts division into division-by-reciprocal rather than recognizing division-by-decimal as reciprocal multiplication. \n\nThe error is distinct from power-of-10 decimal placement errors (which preserve operation direction) or arithmetic mistakes, as the student fundamentally misapplied the reciprocal relationship. Their calculation shows an inversion of the required operation, not a misplaced decimal or digit alignment issue.",
