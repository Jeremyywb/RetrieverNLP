  "explanation": "The correct equation combines the angles through addition: \\( f + (f - 20) = 360 \\), simplifying to \\( 2f - 20 = 360 \\). The student, however, wrote \\( f^2 - 20 = 360 \\), replacing the sum \\( f + f \\) with \\( f^2 \\). This error stems from conflating the coefficient in \\( 2f \\) (which represents \\( f + f \\)) with an exponent, incorrectly interpreting \"two instances of \\( f \\)\" as requiring squaring instead of linear addition. The misconception directly links to treating multiplication by a number (e.g., \\( 2f \\)) as equivalent to exponentiation (\\( f^2 \\)). This is distinct from related errors like confusing squaring with doubling or general multiplication misuse, as the error specifically substitutes additive combination with an exponential form without justification from the problem's context.",
