  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nArea = (a + b)/2 \u00d7 h\n40 = (6 + 10)/2 \u00d7 h \u2192 40 = 8h \u2192 h = 5 cm\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n40 = (6 + 10) \u00d7 h \u2192 40 = 16h \u2192 h = 2.5 cm (not 8 cm)\nBut this does not match the student's answer. Alternatively:\nIf student used area = shorter base \u00d7 h: 40 = 6 \u00d7 h \u2192 h \u2248 6.66 cm (also not 8 cm)\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student treated the trapezium as a single rectangle with height equal to the average base length (8 cm) rather than using the trapezium formula. They likely equated the height directly to (6 + 10)/2 = 8 cm, bypassing the required multiplication with height in the area formula.\n\nMisconception link:\nThis stems from conflating the trapezium's average base length with its total height requirement, effectively collapsing two distinct components of the formula into one. The error differs from using a parallelogram formula (which would retain multiplication with height) or not knowing the formula entirely (which might involve random guessing).\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike simply forgetting the trapezium formula or applying a parallelogram's formula, this error specifically misattributes the role of the averaged base length as the final height measurement.",
