  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows:\n231 \u00f7 4 = 57.75, derived by continuing division after the integer remainder:\n3 (remaining after 4\u00d757=228) becomes 3.00, then 4\u00d70.75=3.00, leaving no remainder. \n\nThe student stopped at the integer division step:\n231 - (4\u00d757) = 3, interpreting this whole-number remainder as the final answer. \n\nThe error stems from truncating the division process after the integer quotient, failing to convert the leftover whole-number remainder (3) into its exact decimal equivalent by dividing it by 4. This aligns with treating remainders as terminal values rather than intermediate steps to be processed further. \n\nThe distinction from \"difficulty with real-world context\" or \"writing fractions\" is clear: the problem explicitly asks for the exact remainder (a decimal), not an integer remainder or its fractional form. The student\u2019s answer directly reflects prematurely halting division, not confusion about representation formats.",
