  "explanation": "The correct calculations are:\n- Tom: 15 - 20 = -5 (valid subtraction resulting in negative number)\n- Katie: (-5) + 20 = 15 (inverse operation verifying the subtraction)\n\nThe student rejected both valid equations. Their error stems from:\n1. Disregarding Tom's correct subtraction because they likely believe subtraction must always yield a non-negative result when working with positive starting numbers. This caused them to dismiss \"15 - 20\" as invalid rather than recognizing negative results are permissible.\n\n2. Failing to see Katie's addition as verification of Tom's result. While they might have recognized \"(-5) + 20\" numerically equals 15, they didn't connect this to validating the original subtraction, indicating a disconnect between inverse operations.\n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception about negative subtraction results rather than general arithmetic errors. The student specifically misapplied subtraction rules (rejecting 15-20) rather than misunderstanding addition itself, distinguishing this from pure inverse-operation misunderstandings. Their simultaneous rejection of both statements shows a compounded error where invalidating the subtraction prevented recognition of the inverse relationship.",
