  "explanation": "The correct answer requires a line graph to represent continuous quantitative data (traffic levels) changing over time, where time is the independent variable. The student incorrectly selected categorical data (animal types) which compares discrete quantities across categories. Their reasoning likely conflated numerical counts (how many animals) with the need for a continuous independent variable like time. This stems from not recognizing that line graphs require a quantitative independent variable (typically time) to show trends, whereas categorical comparisons use bar graphs. The error aligns with failing to identify time as the necessary variable, rather than confusing data types (since both answers use quantitative data) or misclassifying qualitative data.",
