  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Between 0 (1st dash) and 2 (9th dash), there are 8 equal intervals. Each interval = 2 \u00f7 8 = 0.25. The 8th dash is 7 intervals from 0: 0 + 7\u00d70.25 = 1.75.\n\nStudent's error: The answer 1.8 suggests they calculated 8\u00d7(2\u00f79) \u22481.78 (rounded to 1.8). This occurs when dividing the total range (2) by the number of dashes (9) instead of intervals (8).\n\nFlaw: The student treated dashes as direct markers of quantity rather than boundaries between intervals. By dividing 2 by 9 dashes instead of 8 intervals, they incorrectly assumed each dash represented 2/9 rather than 2/8.\n\nConnection to misconception: This stems from not recognizing that intervals = dashes - 1, requiring equivalent fractions (2/8 = 0.25). The student failed to adjust for the relationship between divisions and endpoints.\n\nDistinction: This is not an estimation error (answer is precise) or a decimal misread (scale isn't tenths). The core issue is incorrect interval calculation due to misapplied fractions, not assumptions about base-10 scales.",
