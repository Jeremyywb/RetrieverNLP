  "explanation": "The correct gradient calculation uses two points, e.g., (0,0) and (1,1):\n\\[\n\\text{Gradient} = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 - 0} = 1\n\\]\nThe student answered \\( x \\), likely reasoning as follows:\n- Observed that the line passes through points where \\( y = x \\)\n- Incorrectly interpreted the equation \\( y = x \\) as implying the gradient is the variable \\( x \\) itself\n\nThe error stems from misidentifying the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the equation \\( y = 1x \\). The student conflated the variable \\( x \\) with the gradient, failing to recognize that the implicit coefficient 1 (not \\( x \\)) determines the slope. This aligns with misapplying slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + c \\), where \\( m \\) is numerical. Related misconceptions (e.g., gradient as a root) are less plausible here, as the error directly substitutes \\( x \\) for \\( m \\).",
