  "explanation": "The correct simplification divides numerator and denominator by their GCD (15): \\( \\frac{45 \\div 15}{60 \\div 15} = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nThe student likely divided both terms by 5: \\( \\frac{45 \\div 5}{60 \\div 5} = \\frac{9}{12} \\).\n\nThe error stems from recognizing 5 as a common factor but failing to recognize that 15 (3\u00d75) is also a common divisor. While 9/12 can be reduced further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3, the student stopped at a partial simplification.\n\nThis shows the student identified a valid common factor but not the greatest one. The misconception specifically involves not verifying whether remaining terms still share factors after initial simplification, unlike errors involving non-prime factors (5 is prime) or arithmetic operations other than division.\n\nThe key distinction is that the student applied division correctly but with an incomplete factorization process, rather than misunderstanding what constitutes a valid simplification method.",
