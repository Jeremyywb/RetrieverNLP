  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n- At t=8s, position value directly from graph: 15m\n- Starting position at t=0s: 6m\n- Displacement: 15m - 6m = 9m\n\nStudent's Likely Calculation:\n- Read position at t=8s as 14.5m (graph value)\n- Subtracted origin (assumed to be 0m): 14.5m - 0m = 14.5m\n\nKey Flaw:\nThe student treated the vertical axis as absolute distance from 0 rather than recognizing the graph begins at (0,6). This caused them to use the raw position value (14.5m) instead of calculating displacement from the starting point (14.5m - 6m). The error stems from assuming the first plotted point (0,6) represents 0 displacement rather than an initial offset.\n\nDistinction from Related Errors:\nThis differs from slope misinterpretations (which would affect velocity calculations) or axis-swapping errors (which would invert time/position values). The core issue is specifically mishandling the axis offset, not general graph-reading errors.\n\nAlignment with Misconception:\nThe primary misconception matches perfectly: The student ignored the 6m offset between the true origin (0m) and the first marked value at t=0s, treating the vertical axis as an absolute scale starting at 0.",
