  "explanation": "Correct approach: The sum of angles around a point equals 360\u00b0, giving \\( f + (f-20) = 360 \\), which simplifies to \\( 2f - 20 = 360 \\).\n\nStudent's error: They wrote \\( f - 20 = f \\), treating the two angles as equal rather than summing them. This occurred because they equated the visually presented angles without accounting for their labeled difference.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student assumed equality between angles based on diagram appearance, overriding the explicit \\( f \\) and \\( f-20 \\) labels. This directly maps to misinterpreting visual similarity as mathematical equality.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike misconceptions about angle sums (180\u00b0 vs. 360\u00b0) or missing angles, this error specifically substitutes summation with false equivalence. The student didn't attempt to calculate a total but instead conflated distinct angle measures.\n\nMathematical consequence: Setting \\( f - 20 = f \\) creates an impossible equation (-20 = 0), demonstrating how visual assumptions invalidated the algebraic relationship.",
