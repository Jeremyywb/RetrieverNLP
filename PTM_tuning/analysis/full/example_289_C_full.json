  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n8 (ones) \u00d7 7 = 56 \u2192 write 6, carry 5  \n3 (tens) \u00d7 7 = 21 + 5 = 26 \u2192 write 6 (tens digit), carry 2  \n5 (hundreds) \u00d7 7 = 35 + 2 = 37  \n\nStudent's error:\nAt the tens digit step, they likely calculated 3 + 7 = 10 instead of 3 \u00d7 7 = 21. This would produce 0 in the tens place (from 10) and carry 1, bypassing the required multiplication.  \n\nThe flaw stems from substituting addition for multiplication at the tens place. This directly replaces the required partial product (21) with a sum (10), altering both the digit value and subsequent carries.  \n\nDistinguishing from related errors:  \n- Not a general multiplication failure (they handled 8\u00d77=56 correctly)  \n- Not adding in the ones column (the error occurred at the tens step)  \n- Specifically misapplied addition where multiplication was required for the tens digit calculation.",
