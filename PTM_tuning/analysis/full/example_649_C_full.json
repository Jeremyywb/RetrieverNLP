  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows \\(5 \\times 3.9 = 19.5\\), while \\(3 \\times 5.9 = 17.7\\), proving Tom's equation false. Katie's statement \\(5 \\times 3.9 = 3.9 \\times 5\\) holds because multiplication is commutative. \n\nThe student incorrectly assumed Tom's rearrangement of digits (swapping 5 and 3 between whole and decimal positions) preserves equality. This error stems from treating individual digits as interchangeable components rather than recognizing their positional value. By moving the 3 to the whole number and 5 to the decimal, they altered both factors: 3.9 (3 + 0.9) became 5.9 (5 + 0.9), changing their products. \n\nThis misconception specifically involves misapplying number structure, not a failure to recognize commutativity. Katie correctly applied commutativity by swapping entire factors, while Tom's error modified the numerical values themselves. The student conflated rearranging digits with swapping factors, a distinction not addressed by the related misconceptions about commutativity.",
