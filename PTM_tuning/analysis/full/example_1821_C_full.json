  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Factors of 8 are {1,2,4,8}, factors of 20 are {1,2,4,5,10,20}. Common factors are {1,2,4}, with 4 being the highest.\n\nStudent's error: Selected 8 as a common factor. While 8 divides 8, 20 \u00f7 8 = 2.5 (not an integer), so 8 is not a factor of 20.\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student likely confused the role of 8 as a factor of itself with its relationship to 20. They recognized 8 as a factor of 8 and incorrectly assumed it must also divide 20 because 8 is a multiple of 4 (the true common factor). This shows a confusion between factors (divisors) and multiples (products).\n\nMisconception link: The error stems from treating a multiple of a valid common factor (4) as if it were itself a factor of both numbers. This conflates the distinct concepts of factors and multiples.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: This is not a case of identifying a non-highest common factor (since 8 isn't a common factor) or digit-based reasoning. The error specifically involves misapplying relationships between multiples and factors.\n\nConclusion: The student conflated the multiplicative relationship (8 being 4\u00d72) with divisibility, incorrectly assuming multiples of common factors retain divisibility.",
