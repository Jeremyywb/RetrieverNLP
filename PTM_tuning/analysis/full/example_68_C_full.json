  "explanation": "Correct solution:\nFor \\((w-4)^2 +16=0\\):\n1. Subtract 16: \\((w-4)^2 = -16\\)\n2. Square of real number cannot be negative \u21d2 No real solutions\n\nStudent's error:\nFor \\((w-4)^2=0\\):\n1. Take square roots: \\(w-4=0\\)\n2. Solution: \\(w=4\\) (real solution)\n\nThe student incorrectly identified an equation with one real solution (double root at w=4) as having no solutions. This stems from conflating \"zero real solutions\" (when discriminant < 0) with \"zero value in equation\" (when discriminant = 0). They misapplied discriminant interpretation, believing a perfect square equation (discriminant=0) indicates no solutions rather than one repeated solution.\n\nThis specifically aligns with the discriminant misconception rather than the \"0 isn't real\" error, as the actual solution (w=4) is non-zero. The student confused different discriminant cases rather than rejecting valid solutions.",
