  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows both denominators work:\n- Tom's method: \\( \\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n- Katie's method: \\( \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{15}{18} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6}{18} \\), so \\( \\frac{15}{18} - \\frac{6}{18} = \\frac{9}{18} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nThe student likely concluded only Tom was correct because they incorrectly assumed the smallest common denominator (6) is the only valid choice. They failed to recognize that equivalence is preserved when both fractions are scaled to *any* common multiple of the original denominators (6 and 18 are both multiples of 3 and 6). This error stems from conflating the efficiency of the least common denominator with being the sole valid option. The student correctly applied common denominators but restricted their validity to the smallest one, unlike related misconceptions like ignoring common denominators entirely or simplification errors.",
