  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{4}{20} = 0.2 \\), achieved by dividing 4 \u00f7 20 = 0.2.\n\nIncorrect approach: The student likely treated the numerator (4) as the whole number part and the denominator (20) as the decimal portion, writing them consecutively as \\( 4.20 \\).\n\nSpecific flaw: The student misinterpreted the fraction structure as representing separate integer and decimal components rather than a division operation. This caused them to concatenate the numerator and denominator instead of performing division.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly matches the misconception of using the numerator as the whole part and denominator as the decimal part, bypassing division entirely.\n\nDistinction from others: Unlike percentage-related errors, there's no decimal shift or percentage symbol. The error also differs from simply writing the denominator after a decimal (which would yield 0.20) since the numerator was preserved as the integer portion.\n\nKey takeaway: The student fundamentally misunderstood how fractions encode division, treating their components as positional place values in a decimal number.",
