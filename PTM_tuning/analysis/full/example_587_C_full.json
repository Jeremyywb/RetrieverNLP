  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- For both problems, division and multiplication have equal precedence and are evaluated left-to-right.\n- Problem Q: \\(6 \\div 3 = 2\\) first, then \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n- Problem Q: Calculated \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) first, then \\(6 \\div 15 = 0.4\\).\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student treated multiplication as having higher priority than division in Problem Q, despite their equal precedence. This stems from applying operations right-to-left instead of left-to-right when equal-priority operations appear sequentially. \n\nThe error shows the student prioritized the rightmost operation (multiplication) over the leftmost one (division), violating the left-to-right rule for same-precedence operations. This distinguishes it from related misconceptions like ignoring all priorities (left-to-right regardless of operation type) or misordering operation types (e.g., addition before multiplication). The error specifically reflects a right-to-left sequencing preference for equal-priority operations.",
