  "explanation": "To reflect (2,5) over x=2: The vertical line x=2 passes through Q, so reflection leaves coordinates unchanged. Correct calculation shows (2,5).\n\nThe student changed the y-coordinate to -5, implying they computed (2,5) \u2192 (2,-5). This indicates they applied a reflection rule that flips the y-coordinate.\n\nThe error stems from treating x=2 as the x-axis (y=0) rather than a vertical line. Reflecting over the x-axis would invert y, but x=2 is vertical and doesn't affect y. \n\nThis directly matches the misconception of confusing x=2 (vertical) with the x-axis (horizontal). Related misconceptions like confusing x=2 with y=2 would produce different errors (e.g., (2,-1)), distinguishing this as a case of axis misidentification rather than incorrect horizontal reflection rules.",
