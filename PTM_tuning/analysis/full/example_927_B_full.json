  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (5\u00d73 + 6\u00d74 + 7\u00d712 + 8\u00d71) \u00f7 20 = 131 \u00f7 20 = 6.55 \u2192 6.6 (1 dp)\n\nStudent's likely calculation: (5\u00d73 + 6\u00d74 + 7\u00d712 + 8\u00d71) \u00f7 4 = 131 \u00f7 4 = 32.75\n\nThe student correctly calculated the total spots (131) but divided by the number of categories (4) instead of the total frequency (20). This shows they confused the number of distinct spot values with the total count of ladybirds. The error stems from misunderstanding the mean's denominator, treating grouped data as individual categories rather than aggregated counts. This differs from dividing raw numbers without any calculation (which would skip multiplication steps) or misdefining total frequency itself. The specific flaw is using category count as the divisor rather than total observations.",
