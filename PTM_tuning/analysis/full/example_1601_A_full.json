  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n2(5x + 4) = 10x + 8  \n-4(x - 7) = -4x + 28  \nCombined: 10x + 8 - 4x + 28 = 6x + 36 \u2192 A = 6\n\nStudent's likely steps:\n2(5x) = 10x (correct)  \n-4(x) = -4x (correct)  \nBut when combining coefficients:  \n10x - 4x = 4x (instead of 6x)  \n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student subtracted 4 from the coefficient 10 incorrectly (10 - 4 = 6 mathematically), but their calculation shows they treated 10x - 4x as yielding 4x rather than 6x. This indicates a sign assignment error during combination, where they likely miscalculated the directional impact of subtracting 4x from 10x.\n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis differs from bracket-expansion errors (e.g., ignoring distribution) because the student correctly expanded both brackets. The error occurred exclusively during term combination, not during distribution.\n\nConclusion:  \nThe student recognized the need to combine like terms but misapplied subtraction when reconciling positive and negative coefficients, directly aligning with the \"positivity/negativity assignment\" misconception.",
