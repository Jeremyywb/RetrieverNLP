  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times (-6) = \\frac{1 \\times (-6)}{3 \\times 1} = \\frac{-6}{3} = -2 \\).\n\nIncorrect calculation: The student likely treated \\(-6\\) as \\(\\frac{-6}{1}\\), took its reciprocal (\\(\\frac{1}{-6}\\)), then multiplied: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{-6} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{3 \\times (-6)} = \\frac{-1}{18} \\).\n\nThe error occurred because the student incorrectly applied division's reciprocal rule to multiplication. Instead of directly multiplying numerators and denominators, they inverted the second term. This matches the misconception of using division's method (reciprocal) for multiplication. \n\nIt differs from \"cross-multiplying diagonally\" (which would also produce \\(-1/18\\) here but involves a different procedural error) and from multiplying both numerator and denominator by the integer (which would yield \\(\\frac{-6}{18}\\) instead). The specific inversion of the second term directly links to the reciprocal misconception.",
