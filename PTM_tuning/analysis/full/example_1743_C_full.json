  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. \u00a3150 increased by 60%: 150 \u00d7 1.60 = \u00a3240\n2. \u00a3240 increased by 10%: 240 \u00d7 1.10 = \u00a3264\n3. Final amount as percentage: (264/150) \u00d7 100 = 176%\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nIf the student added percentage increases directly:\n1. First increase: 150 + (60% of 150) = 240\n2. Second increase: 240 + (10% of 150) = 240 + 15 = 255\n3. Incorrect percentage: (255/150) \u00d7 100 = 170%\n\nAlternatively, if they multiplied 1.6 \u00d7 1.1 incorrectly as 1.66 instead of 1.76:\n150 \u00d7 1.66 = 249 \u2192 249/150 = 166%\n\nKey flaw: The student treated the second percentage increase (10%) as a fixed additive value relative to the original amount (\u00a315) rather than compounding it on the new amount (\u00a3240). This misapplies percentage increases as sequential additive operations instead of multiplicative compounding.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error reflects a failure to recognize that successive percentage changes must be applied to the updated value, not the original base. This aligns with misapplying percentage multipliers rather than misunderstanding decimal conversions.\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"forgetting to add 100%\" or arithmetic errors, as the student correctly calculated individual percentages but misapplied their scope. The core issue is misrepresenting how percentages compound sequentially.",
