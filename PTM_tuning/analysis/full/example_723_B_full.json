  "explanation": "The correct approach solves \\(x^2 - x - 9 = -6\\) by finding where the graph \\(y = x^2 - x - 9\\) intersects \\(y = -6\\). This requires identifying the points on the graph where the \\(y\\)-value is \\(-6\\), leading to \\(x \\approx 2.2\\) and \\(x \\approx -1.2\\).\n\nThe student likely located the \\(x\\)-intercepts of \\(y = x^2 - x - 9\\) (where \\(y = 0\\)) instead of the intersection with \\(y = -6\\). Solving \\(x^2 - x - 9 = 0\\) via quadratic formula gives roots near \\(3.5\\) and \\(-2.5\\), matching the student's answers. \n\nThe error stems from misidentifying the horizontal line to intersect: the student used \\(y = 0\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis) instead of \\(y = -6\\). This directly corresponds to using the graph's \\(x\\)-intercepts (wrong data points) rather than the correct intersection with \\(y = -6\\). \n\nThis is distinct from substituting \\(x\\)-values without setting \\(y = 0\\) (the student did set \\(y = 0\\), but for the wrong equation) or symmetry misconceptions. The scale assumption is also irrelevant here, as the error is purely about misinterpreting which \\(y\\)-value defines the solutions.",
