  "explanation": "The correct output follows the function machine's sequence: divide by 5 first (\\(n \\div 5\\)), then add 3 (\\(+3\\)), resulting in \\( \\frac{n}{5} + 3 \\). The student incorrectly equated this with \\( \\frac{n+3}{5} \\), which reverses the operation order (add 3 first, then divide). \n\nThe error stems from treating the operations as order-independent. The student likely assumed both expressions are equivalent because they did not enforce the strict left-to-right sequence implied by the function machine. This reflects a failure to recognize that reversing the operation order fundamentally alters the numerator in Paul's answer, where addition incorrectly precedes division. \n\nThe misconception aligns with misapplying operation order (right-to-left instead of left-to-right) but differs from bracket-related errors, as no parentheses were present in the original problem. The student conflated the two distinct expressions by disregarding sequential execution, not merely misprioritizing operator precedence.",
