  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nSum of angles in quadrilateral = \\( s + 2s + 2s + 3s = 8s \\)\nEquation: \\( 8s = 360^{\\circ} \\) \u2192 \\( s = 45^{\\circ} \\)\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\nSummed angles as \\( 2s + 2s + 3s = 7s \\)\nEquation: \\( 7s = 360^{\\circ} \\) \u2192 \\( s \\approx 51.4^{\\circ} \\)\n\nSpecific reasoning flaw:\nThe student omitted the first angle \\( s \\) when combining like terms, reducing the total coefficient from 8 to 7. This indicates a failure to recognize that all angle terms (\\( s, 2s, 2s, 3s \\)) must be included when summing. The error stems from incomplete collection of like terms during equation setup, not from misapplying division or misinterpreting multiplication symbols. This aligns with the \"when like terms can be collected\" misconception rather than coefficient elimination errors or misinterpretation of algebraic notation.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThe student correctly divided by their coefficient (7) and recognized multiplicative relationships (e.g., \\( 2s \\)), ruling out division-commutativity or term-interpretation errors. The core issue was term omission during summation.",
