  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes that \\( \\frac{a}{b+c} \\) and \\( a \\div (b+c) \\) both represent dividing \\( a \\) by the sum \\( b+c \\), making them equivalent by definition. \n\nThe student likely interpreted \\( a \\div b+c \\) (without parentheses) as \\( (a \\div b) + c \\), incorrectly assuming the division symbol introduces ambiguity. However, the explicit parentheses in \\( a \\div (b+c) \\) ensure the sum is treated as a single divisor, matching the fraction's denominator. \n\nThe flaw stems from misapplying order of operations to the division symbol, failing to recognize that parentheses in \\( a \\div (b+c) \\) resolve ambiguity just as the fraction bar does. This directly connects to the misconception that notation differences imply operational differences, even when parentheses clarify grouping.\n\nThis explanation distinguishes from related misconceptions: the error is not about fraction interpretation generally, but specifically about equating the division symbol with the fraction bar when parentheses are present. The student's uncertainty about needing \"more information\" arises from incorrectly perceiving ambiguity where none exists.",
