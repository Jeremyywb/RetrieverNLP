  "explanation": "To determine rotational symmetry order, divide 360\u00b0 by the smallest rotation angle that maps the shape onto itself. For a rectangle, this angle is 180\u00b0, yielding order \\( \\frac{360\u00b0}{180\u00b0} = 2 \\). \n\nThe student likely observed that a regular hexagon aligns with itself after a 180\u00b0 rotation, concluding order 2. However, they failed to recognize that the hexagon also aligns at smaller angles (e.g., 60\u00b0), making the smallest angle 60\u00b0 and the true order \\( \\frac{360\u00b0}{60\u00b0} = 6 \\). \n\nThe error stems from equating *any* rotational alignment with the symmetry order, rather than identifying the minimal angle required for alignment. This directly corresponds to misunderstanding how symmetry order is defined mathematically. \n\nThe misconception differs from confusing rotational symmetry with line symmetry or assuming regularity guarantees certain properties, as the student specifically misapplied the angle calculation. Their focus on 180\u00b0 alignment alone (a property rectangles *correctly* exhibit) shows they conflated partial rotational matches with the full order determination.",
