  "explanation": "The correct first step adds 4 to both sides: \\( \\frac{m}{6} -4 +4 =24+4 \\) \u2192 \\( \\frac{m}{6}=28 \\). \n\nPaul's incorrect step likely came from multiplying both sides by 6 prematurely but only applying it to \\( \\frac{m}{6} \\), resulting in \\( m -4=144 \\) instead of \\( m -24=144 \\). \n\nThe student assumed multiplying by 6 only affects the fractional term, neglecting to apply it to the entire left side. This reflects a misunderstanding that clearing fractions requires multiplying every term by the denominator. \n\nThe error specifically stems from improper fraction elimination, not a general operation inversion or grouping error. While related to \"incorrectly clears fractions,\" it specifically involves partial application of multiplication to terms rather than other fraction-related errors like misapplying inverse operations.\n\nThis distinction shows the exact point where the student's reasoning diverged: they allowed an unequal scaling of terms when manipulating the equation.",
