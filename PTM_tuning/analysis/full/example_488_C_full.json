  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( (-3) + (-5) = -8 \\) (summing negatives increases magnitude in the negative direction).  \nStudent's error: Calculated \\( 3 + 5 = 8 \\), omitting both negatives.  \n\nThe student treated \\(-3\\) and \\(-5\\) as their absolute values, disregarding the negative signs entirely. This reflects a direct failure to recognize that the signs modify the value being summed, not just the operation.  \n\nThis matches the misconception of ignoring negative signs during addition, as the student defaulted to unsigned arithmetic. It differs from related errors like confusing number-line direction (which would still yield a negative answer) or misapplying operation rules (e.g., subtraction), which are not evident here.",
