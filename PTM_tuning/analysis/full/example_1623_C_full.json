  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Identify months with temperature >23\u00b0C from plotted points: June (25), July (29), August (32), September (27) \u2192 4 months.\n\nStudent's error: Likely counted May (23) as exceeding the threshold, or included transitional periods between months. The line connecting May (23) to June (25) crosses 23\u00b0C, potentially making the student count the May-June transition as exceeding 23\u00b0C. However, only discrete monthly points should be considered.\n\nReasoning flaw: The student treated the continuous line graph as representing temperature throughout the month rather than discrete monthly averages. This caused them to count intervals where the line exceeded 23\u00b0C (e.g., late May/early June) as full qualifying months.\n\nDistinction: This differs from scale misreading (which would affect multiple values) or threshold inclusion (which would involve exact 23\u00b0C). The error specifically stems from misinterpreting the graph's continuous lines as data rather than connections between discrete points.\n\nConclusion: By focusing on the line's position rather than the plotted points, the student added an extra month where the temperature transition occurred, resulting in 5 instead of 4.",
