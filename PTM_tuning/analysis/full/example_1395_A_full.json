  "explanation": "To determine parallel lines, the slopes must be equal. Tom's equations \\( y = 5x + 7 \\) and \\( y = 3x + 7 \\) have different slopes (5 vs. 3), so they are not parallel. Katie's equations \\( y = 5x + 7 \\) and \\( y = 5x - 22 \\) share the slope 5, making them parallel. \n\nThe student incorrectly concluded only Tom was correct. This suggests they focused on the shared y-intercept (7) in Tom's equations, treating it as sufficient for parallelism. The error arises from conflating the y-intercept's role with the slope's requirement for equality. \n\nThe misconception here is prioritizing the y-intercept over the slope, rather than misunderstanding the slope's exclusive role. This differs from related errors like confusing the gradient and y-intercept variables (\\( m \\) vs. \\( c \\)) or requiring both slope and intercept to match, as the student explicitly selected equations with matching intercepts despite differing slopes.",
