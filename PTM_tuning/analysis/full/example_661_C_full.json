  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \nArea = (base \u00d7 height) \u00f7 2 = (5 \u00d7 2) \u00f7 2 = 5\n\nStudent's likely calculation:  \n5 \u00d7 2 = 10 \u2192 10 \u00f7 2 = 5 (but this would yield the correct answer). However, the student arrived at 6, suggesting they may have counted grid squares instead of using the formula.\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student likely counted all unit squares fully or partially covered by the triangle as whole squares. For example, if the triangle covers 5 full squares and 2 half-squares, the student counted 5 + 2 = 7, then adjusted to 6 (possibly miscounting). This indicates they treated partial squares as full units rather than summing fractional areas.\n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis differs from \"multiplies base and height without dividing by 2\" (which would give 10) or \"only counts fully shaded squares\" (which would undercount). The error stems from overcounting partial squares, not formula misuse.\n\nKey connection:  \nThe student conflated discrete square counting with continuous area measurement, failing to apply the triangle formula or properly account for partial grid units.",
