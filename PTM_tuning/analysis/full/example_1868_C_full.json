  "explanation": "The correct answer requires both the correct angle and center. A 90\u00b0 anticlockwise rotation is equivalent to +270\u00b0, but Jo's statement lacks the center (-1,1). The student likely treated the angle equivalence as sufficient for correctness, ignoring the center specification. Their misconception caused them to equate \"same angle measure\" with \"same full rotation description,\" even though Jo omitted the critical center point. This differs from related errors about choosing the wrong center (Jo didn't pick any center) or miscalculating angles (they correctly recognized 90\u00b0\u2261+270\u00b0). The flaw stems from not recognizing that rotation descriptions require both angle and center to be fully valid.",
