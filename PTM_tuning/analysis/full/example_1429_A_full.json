  "explanation": "The correct solution divides \u00a330 into 3+2=5 equal parts (each \u00a36), with the total bar representing \u00a330. The student's diagram labels each individual block as \u00a330, suggesting they interpreted the ratio numbers 3:2 as complete amounts rather than proportional parts. This indicates they confused the ratio components with absolute values, thinking each \"3\" and \"2\" in the ratio directly corresponded to \u00a330 allocations instead of contributing to the total. The error stems from misinterpreting ratio notation as separate totals rather than relative shares of a whole. This aligns with the primary misconception where the student treats ratio quantities as independent totals, distinct from related errors like miscalculating parts or misapplying operations. Other listed misconceptions (e.g., fraction misunderstanding, operation errors) don't explain labeling individual blocks as the full \u00a330.",
