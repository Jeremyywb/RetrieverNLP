  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n1. Identify first significant figure: 9 in 0.095643 (third digit)  \n2. Check next digit (5) for rounding  \n3. Round 9 up to 10, resulting in 0.1  \n\nStudent's error:  \n1. Kept 0.09 (first two digits after decimal)  \n2. Stopped at second decimal place  \n\nFlaw: The student treated \"1 significant figure\" as \"two decimal places\" (0.09), confusing significant figures with decimal place rounding. They incorrectly counted leading zeros as part of the required accuracy rather than starting from the first non-zero digit. This matches the primary misconception of conflating decimal places with significant figures, not merely truncating digits or applying incorrect rounding rules. The error is distinct from truncation (which would yield 0.09 without considering the 5) or over-rounding (e.g., 0.096 to 0.1 would involve different steps).",
