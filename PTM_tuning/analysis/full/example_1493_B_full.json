  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(6^3\\) first (exponents before division/subtraction)\nStudent's calculation: \\(7 \\div 6\\) first (left-to-right sequence)\n\nThe student incorrectly prioritized division over exponentiation by solving the first adjacent operation pair they encountered (7\u00f76). This shows they failed to recognize that exponents must be resolved before division in the absence of parentheses. The misconception caused them to process visible operations sequentially rather than following hierarchy. \n\nThis differs from right-left errors (which would have produced 6\u00b3\u00f77 first) or universal operation equality (which might mix subtraction/division randomly). The error specifically stems from strict left-right execution while overlooking exponent priority.",
