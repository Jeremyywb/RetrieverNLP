  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{8 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{24} \\).\n\nIncorrect calculation: The student computed \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{3}{1} = \\frac{3}{8} \\), treating the second fraction's reciprocal.\n\nThe flaw stems from applying the division algorithm (inverting the second fraction) to multiplication. Instead of multiplying numerators and denominators directly, the student incorrectly replaced \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) with \\( \\frac{3}{1} \\), multiplying \\( 1 \\times 3 \\) for the numerator and retaining \\( 8 \\) as the denominator. This matches the misconception of using division's reciprocal method for multiplication. \n\nIt differs from cross-multiplication errors (which would also produce \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\)) because cross-multiplication would explicitly involve pairing \\( 1 \\times 3 \\) and \\( 8 \\times 1 \\), whereas this error specifically substitutes the second fraction with its reciprocal, reflecting a confusion between multiplication and division operations.",
