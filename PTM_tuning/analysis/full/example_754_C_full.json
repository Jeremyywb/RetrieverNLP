  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Start with \\( y = x^2 - 2x - 3 \\)\n2. Complete the square: \\( y = (x^2 - 2x + 1) - 1 - 3 \\)\n3. Result: \\( y = (x - 1)^2 - 4 \\), so \\( p = -1 \\)\n\nStudent's error:\n- Likely identified the vertex at (1, -4) but misapplied the relationship between the vertex and the equation form \\( y = (x + p)^2 + q \\)\n- Incorrectly equated \\( p \\) to the y-coordinate of the vertex (-4) instead of using the x-coordinate\n- Derived \\( p = 4 \\) by taking the absolute value of the y-coordinate or misreading axes\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student conflated the vertical translation \\( q \\) (which equals the y-coordinate of the vertex) with the horizontal shift parameter \\( p \\). They substituted the y-coordinate (-4) directly into the position of \\( p \\), ignoring the required sign adjustment for horizontal shifts in the completed square form.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nUnlike confusing the sign of \\( p \\) in \\( (x + p)^2 \\), this error stems from misassigning the vertical component of the vertex to the horizontal shift parameter. The error is specifically about misaligning coordinate values with their respective parameters, not misreading graph axes or sign errors in the completed square form.",
