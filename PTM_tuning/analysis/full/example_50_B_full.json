  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(23.04 \\div 1000 = 0.02304\\) requires shifting the decimal three places left (since \\(1000 = 10^3\\)), resulting in three digits to the right of the original decimal becoming tenths, hundredths, and thousandths.\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\(23.04 \\div 1000 = 0.2304\\) shows the decimal shifted only two places left instead of three. This suggests they treated 1000 as \\(10^2\\) (100) rather than \\(10^3\\), reducing the required decimal shifts by one.\n\nThe error stems from misapplying the relationship between divisor magnitude and decimal movement. The student likely associated \"division by multiple of 10\" with the number of zeros in 1000 but miscounted them (interpreting 3 zeros as 2) or conflated division by 100 and 1000.\n\nThis matches the misconception of incorrectly scaling place value shifts for powers of 10. It differs from \"adding zeros to the start\" because the decimal was moved correctly - just insufficiently - rather than inserting zeros without adjusting the decimal position.\n\nThe error aligns most closely with misjudging the exponent in \\(10^n\\), not ignoring decimal placement entirely. The result is exactly 10 times too large, confirming one missing decimal shift.",
