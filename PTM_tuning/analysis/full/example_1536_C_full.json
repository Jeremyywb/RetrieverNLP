  "explanation": "To calculate the mean: \\( (2 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8) \\div 5 = 20 \\div 5 = 4 \\).  \nThe student likely sorted the numbers \\( 2,2,3,5,8 \\), identified the middle value \\( 3 \\), and reported it as the mean.  \n\nThe error stems from conflating the mean with the median. The student correctly found the median (central value) but incorrectly labeled it as the mean. This confusion caused them to skip calculating the average altogether and instead select the positional middle value.  \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of confusing mean and median calculations. It is distinct from other errors like dividing incorrectly (e.g., \\( 20 \\div 6 \\)) or misapplying mode/mean relationships, as the student's answer matches the exact median value.",
