  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(5^2 = 5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\(5 + 2 = 7\\)\n\nThe student treated the exponent as an addition operation rather than a multiplication. They added the base \\(h=5\\) to the exponent \\(2\\) instead of computing \\(5 \\times 5\\). This directly stems from misinterpreting the squaring operation as requiring addition of the base and exponent rather than repeated multiplication.\n\nThis error differs from multiplying by the index (\\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\)) or confusing order of operations with addition. The specific substitution of addition for exponentiation uniquely explains the result \\(7\\), distinct from other arithmetic misinterpretations.",
