  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires recognizing that \\( 53^{2} \\) means \\( 53 \\times 53 \\). \nThe student instead computed \\( 53 + 2 \\), treating the exponent as a direct additive term rather than an operation. \nThis shows they misinterpreted the squaring notation as an instruction to add the exponent's value (2) to the base number (53), rather than multiplying the base by itself. \nThe error is distinct from multiplying by 2 (which would yield \\( 53 \\times 2 \\)) or confusing the exponent with doubling, as the student specifically replaced the multiplicative operation with addition. \nThis aligns with a fundamental misunderstanding of power notation, where the exponent's role is misapplied as a simple additive modifier instead of defining repeated multiplication.",
