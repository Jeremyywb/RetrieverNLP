  "explanation": "To convert \\( y = x^2 + 8x + 2 \\) to vertex form:\n1. Correct method: \\( x^2 + 8x = (x+4)^2 - 16 \\). Then combine constants: \\( -16 + 2 = -14 \\), giving \\( (x+4)^2 -14 \\).\n2. Student's error: They wrote \\( (x+4)^2 -16 \\), directly using \\( 4^2 =16 \\) as the final constant.\n\nThe flaw occurs when combining constants after completing the square. The student subtracted 16 (the square completion term) but failed to add the original constant (+2). This shows they treated \\( 4^2 \\) as the only required adjustment, neglecting the existing constant in the equation. \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of ignoring the original constant term when completing the square. It's distinct from errors like miscalculating \\( a \\) (they correctly used 8/2=4) or confusing squaring with doubling (no arithmetic error in \\( 4^2 \\)).",
