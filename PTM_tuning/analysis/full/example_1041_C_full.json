  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3600 \\div 60 \\div 60 = 1 \\) hour (seconds \u2192 minutes \u2192 hours).  \nStudent's calculation: \\( 3600 \\div 1000 = 3.6 \\).  \n\nThe student divided by 1000 instead of applying two-stage unit conversion (seconds \u2192 minutes \u2192 hours). This reflects a failure to recognize the hierarchical relationship between seconds, minutes, and hours, treating the conversion as a single-step division by an arbitrary factor. The error aligns with \"simply divides without unit conversion,\" not the primary misconception about 100 seconds/minute. Distinguishing factors: If the student had used 100 seconds/minute, intermediate results like 36 minutes would appear, which are absent here. The error stems from skipping unit conversions entirely, not misdefining minute/second relationships.",
