  "explanation": "The correct answer requires knowing that a rhombus (parallelogram) has diagonals that bisect each other, while a kite only has one diagonal bisected by the other (not mutual bisection). \n\nThe student likely assumed both shapes share full mutual bisection. This stems from conflating the properties of these quadrilaterals: they correctly recognized the rhombus property but incorrectly extended the kite's single-diagonal bisection (where one diagonal is bisected, but not the bisector) to mutual bisection. \n\nThis specific error maps directly to misunderstanding the kite's diagonal properties. The student didn't confuse \"bisect\" with another term (ruling out that misconception) or misinterpret side markings (irrelevant here). The error specifically arises from assigning a parallelogram property (mutual bisection) to a non-parallelogram kite.",
