  "explanation": "To find the first term of \\(5n - 7\\), substitute \\(n=1\\):  \n**Correct calculation:** \\(5(1) - 7 = -2\\).  \n\nThe student likely **equated the coefficient of \\(n\\) (5) to the first term** without substitution. This occurs when interpreting the linear formula as directly stating the term value rather than recognizing it requires inputting \\(n=1\\).  \n\nThe error stems from conflating the role of the coefficient (common difference) with the sequence's starting value. The student treated the arithmetic rule's slope as the initial term, bypassing the necessary calculation.  \n\nThis specifically aligns with misidentifying the common difference as the first term, not confusion about term positions or direct proportionality. Other misconceptions would produce different errors (e.g., answering \\(1\\) for term-position confusion or misapplying proportionality factors differently).",
