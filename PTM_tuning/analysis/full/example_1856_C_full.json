  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Starting with \\( S = \\frac{D}{T} \\), multiplying both sides by \\( T \\) gives \\( D = S \\times T \\).\n\nStudent's error: The student rejected \\( D = S \\times T \\) as incorrect. This implies they likely believed the relationship \\( S = D \\times T \\), where speed equals distance multiplied by time. \n\nFlawed reasoning: If the student assumed \\( S = D \\times T \\), solving for \\( D \\) would erroneously yield \\( D = \\frac{S}{T} \\). This led them to conclude \\( D = S \\times T \\) is invalid, directly contradicting the correct derivation. \n\nConnection to misconception: This stems from believing speed is a product of distance and time, not their ratio. The error reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the speed formula itself, not just algebraic rearrangement. \n\nDistinction: Unlike errors in algebraic manipulation (e.g., forgetting to invert operations), this mistake originates in an incorrect conceptual relationship between the variables. The student didn\u2019t misapply operations to isolate \\( D \\)\u2014they misdefined the formula entirely.",
