  "explanation": "The correct step transforms \\(\\frac{24}{x}=6\\) into \\(24=6x\\) by multiplying both sides by \\(x\\). Katie's incorrect step \\(24=\\frac{x}{6}\\) implies the student rewrote \\(\\frac{24}{x}\\) as \\(\\frac{x}{6}\\), treating division as commutative. \n\nThis error occurred because the student reversed the divisor and dividend, assuming \\(x\\) should divide into 6 rather than 6 multiplying into \\(x\\) after isolating it. The misconception directly caused the inversion of the division relationship when attempting to remove \\(x\\) from the denominator. \n\nThis differs from \"performs division instead of multiplication\" because the error specifically involves reversing the division order, not choosing division over multiplication. The flaw aligns with misapplying division's non-commutative property rather than operational confusion.",
