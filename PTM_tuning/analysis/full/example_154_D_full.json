  "explanation": "The correct time coordinate calculation uses speed (4 m/s) to determine the time axis scale. Total time = total distance/speed = 60m/4m/s = 15s. Three horizontal squares span 15s, making each square 5s. The marked point at one square horizontally corresponds to 5s.\n\nThe student likely assumed each horizontal square matched the vertical axis's 20m increments (0,20,40,60). They counted 1 horizontal square as 20s instead of calculating the true scale (5s/square), leading to (20,40).\n\nThis error stems from assuming identical scales on both axes without verifying them. The vertical axis's labeled 20m increments misled the student to apply the same 20-unit scaling to the unlabeled horizontal axis. This directly aligns with the \"counts squares instead of correct scale\" misconception.\n\nIt's distinct from \"incorrect use of scale\" (which implies misreading labeled scales) because the horizontal axis lacked labels, requiring derivation via speed. The student substituted vertical scaling for horizontal rather than miscalculating a given scale.",
