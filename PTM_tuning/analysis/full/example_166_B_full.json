  "explanation": "Correct calculation after reciprocal step:\n\\(\\frac{x-1}{6} \\times \\frac{9}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\)  \nThe student's incorrect step:  \n\\(\\frac{-1}{6} \\times \\frac{9}{x-1}\\)\n\nThe student incorrectly canceled \\((x-1)\\) in the numerator of the first fraction with the entire denominator \\(x^2-1\\) of the second fraction without first factoring \\(x^2-1\\) into \\((x+1)(x-1)\\). This premature cancellation removed the \\((x-1)\\) term entirely from both fractions, leaving an erroneous \\(-1\\) in the numerator of the first fraction. \n\nThis error stems from treating \\(x^2-1\\) as a single cancellable term with \\(x-1\\), rather than recognizing it as a product of factors. The misconception involves canceling terms that are not identical factors. \n\nThe error differs from subtracting terms (as in \"simplifies by adding/subtracting\") because the student attempted cancellation, not arithmetic subtraction. It also isn't about \"disappearing\" terms, as the \\(-1\\) suggests an invalid substitution rather than simple removal.",
