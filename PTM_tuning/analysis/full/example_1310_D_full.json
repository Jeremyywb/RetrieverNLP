  "explanation": "Correct calculation sequence:\n1. Innermost parentheses: \\( 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6 \\)\n2. Division: \\( 0.5 \\div 0.6 \\)\n3. Subtraction: \\( (0.5 \\div 0.6) - 0.3 \\)\n4. Final multiplication: \\( \\text{(result)} \\times 0.6 \\)\n\nStudent's error:\nSelected \\( 0.3 \\times 0.6 \\) as the first step, skipping the required parentheses resolution.\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student treated the multiplication \\( 0.3 \\times 0.6 \\) as a standalone operation with higher priority than resolving the nested parentheses. They failed to recognize that the entire expression inside the innermost parentheses \\( (0.2 + 0.4) \\) must be evaluated first before any operations outside it can proceed. This reflects a misapplication of hierarchical prioritization, where the structural role of parentheses to isolate sub-expressions was overlooked.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThis is not a strict left-to-right error (as the student prioritized multiplication over division/subtraction) or a belief that order doesn\u2019t matter. The error specifically stems from misjudging the scope of parentheses and prematurely executing operations outside them.",
