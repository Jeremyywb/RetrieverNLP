  "explanation": "**Correct Calculation:**  \nMultiply numerators: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\).  \nMultiply denominators: \\(9 \\times 5 = 45\\).  \nResult: \\(\\frac{1}{45}\\).\n\n**Student's Likely Error:**  \nNumerator: \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) (cross-multiplying diagonally).  \nDenominator: \\(9 \\times 1 = 9\\) (remaining diagonal).  \nResult: \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\n**Flawed Reasoning:**  \nThe student treated fraction multiplication as a cross-multiplication step from solving proportions. They multiplied the first numerator (1) and second denominator (5) to create the numerator, then the first denominator (9) and second numerator (1) for the denominator. This violates the rule for multiplying fractions directly across.\n\n**Distinction from Related Errors:**  \nIf they had used division, they would have inverted the second fraction, resulting in \\(\\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{5}{1} = \\frac{5}{9}\\). However, this matches the answer accidentally, not the reasoning. The cross-multiplication pattern uniquely explains the diagonal multiplication observed here, unlike adding denominators or retaining a single denominator.",
