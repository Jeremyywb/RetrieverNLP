  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The angle is measured clockwise from 0\u00b0 on the outer scale to the second line at 205\u00b0, giving \\(205^\\circ\\).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely read the inner scale at the second line (335\u00b0) and subtracted this from 360\u00b0, assuming it represented the smaller angle: \\(360^\\circ - 335^\\circ = 25^\\circ\\). They then incorrectly calculated the reflex angle as \\(360^\\circ - 15^\\circ = 345^\\circ\\), likely misaligning the starting point.\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student used the inner scale's value (335\u00b0) but treated it as the smaller angle's complement, failing to recognize the outer scale's 0\u00b0 alignment. This caused them to miscalculate the reflex angle by starting from the wrong numerical reference on the protractor.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error stems from correctly choosing the outer scale but misaligning the starting point (0\u00b0 vs. 180\u00b0), leading to incorrect subtraction. This is distinct from rotating the protractor incorrectly or misreading direction, as the scale choice was correct but the starting reference was misapplied.\n\nDistinction: Unlike direction-related errors, the student\u2019s mistake specifically involved misusing the inner scale\u2019s value while attempting to use the outer scale\u2019s alignment, conflating the two scales\u2019 starting points.",
