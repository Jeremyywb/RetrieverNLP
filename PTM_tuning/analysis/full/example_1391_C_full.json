  "explanation": "Correct solution:\n1. Factor the equation: \\( k(k - 8) = 0 \\)\n2. Apply zero-product property: \\( k = 0 \\) or \\( k - 8 = 0 \\)\n3. Solutions: \\( k = 0 \\) and \\( k = 8 \\)\n\nStudent's error:\n- After factoring \\( k(k - 8) = 0 \\), the student likely identified the constant term in the second factor (8) but ignored the first factor \\( k \\), which corresponds to the solution \\( k = 0 \\).\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student treated only the explicit constant term in the factor \\( (k - 8) \\) as a solution source, taking its absolute value (8), but failed to recognize that the factor \\( k \\) (equivalent to \\( k - 0 \\)) introduces \\( k = 0 \\) as a valid solution. This reflects a selective application of the zero-product property, where solutions are erroneously tied only to visible constants in subtracted forms.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThis error specifically involves incomplete identification of factors rather than misunderstanding the equation's standard form, misapplying difference of squares, or assuming all quadratics inherently include 0. The student correctly factored the equation but neglected one factor's solution.",
