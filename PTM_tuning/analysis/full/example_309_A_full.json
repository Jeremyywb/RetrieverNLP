  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\)  \nStudent's calculation: \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nThe student misidentified the total number of equal parts in the whole bar. The bar has 4 main sections (quarters), but they treated the green subsection divisions as equivalent to whole-bar partitions, counting 5 total parts instead of 4. This caused them to use \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) (representing 2 of 5 imagined equal parts) rather than \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\). The error directly stems from conflating subdivisions within a single quarter with partitions of the entire bar. This matches the \"confuses fifths with quarters\" misconception, as opposed to general diagram misinterpretation or whole-amount errors, which would produce different denominators or miscalculations.",
