  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying base (3) and height (2x):  \n\\( A = 3 \\times 2x = 6x \\).\n\nStudent's error: The student computed \\( (3)^2 \\times (2x)^2 = 9 \\times 4x^2 = 36x^2 \\).\n\nReasoning flaw: The student squared both dimensions independently before multiplying them, treating the linear terms as if they required squaring. This reflects a misunderstanding of when squaring applies: it is only used when two identical terms are multiplied (e.g., side length \u00d7 side length for a square), not for multiplying distinct linear dimensions like base and height.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly stems from misapplying squaring to separate terms in a multiplicative context, rather than recognizing that the formula requires simple multiplication of distinct linear measurements. This distinguishes it from related errors like confusing triangle area (which involves halving) or multiplying all constants and variables without squaring.\n\nDistinction: Unlike \"multiplies all terms together,\" the student introduced exponents where none were needed. The error also isn't a confusion with triangle area, as no division by 2 occurred.",
