  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (0+0+2+6+9)/5 = 17/5, equivalent to (2+6+9)/5 since zeros contribute 0 to the sum. \n\nThe student likely calculated the sum (0+0+2+6+9=17) but divided by 3 instead of 5, reasoning that only non-zero values (2,6,9) count toward the divisor. This produces 17/3 \u22485.67, which matches none of the provided options. \n\nThe error stems from excluding zeros when determining the divisor for the mean, despite their presence in the dataset. This specifically aligns with the misconception of not counting zeros in the denominator. \n\nDistinct from related errors: The student did divide (ruling out \"no division\") and didn't use reciprocal division (1/5). Their exclusion of zeros specifically in the divisor, not the sum, differentiates this from other listed misconceptions.",
