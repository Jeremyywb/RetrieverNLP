  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n\\[\n(2n-1) + (2m+1) = 2n + 2m = 2(n+m)\n\\]\n\nStudent's error:\n\\[\n2n + (2m+1) = 2(n+m) + 1\n\\]\n\nThe student misrepresented one odd number as \\(2n\\) (which is even) instead of using two expressions of the form \\(2k \\pm 1\\). This caused their \"sum\" to mix an even and odd number, resulting in an odd total. The core flaw is failing to recognize that both addends must retain a \\(\\pm 1\\) term to remain odd before cancellation. Their setup violates the parity requirement of the problem, not an algebraic error in distribution or term collection. Related misconceptions like commutative property issues are irrelevant here, as the mistake occurs earlier in defining the numbers. The final +1 shows they correctly handled existing terms but started with invalid premises.",
