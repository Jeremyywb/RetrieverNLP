  "explanation": "To solve \\( 0.45 = 0.3 p \\), divide both sides by \\( 0.3 \\):  \n\\( p = \\frac{0.45}{0.3} = 1.5 \\).  \n\nThe student likely computed \\( p = \\frac{0.3}{0.45} \\), yielding \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).  \n\nThis error stems from reversing the dividend and divisor when isolating \\( p \\). Instead of dividing \\( 0.45 \\) (dividend) by \\( 0.3 \\) (divisor), they treated \\( 0.3 \\) as the dividend and \\( 0.45 \\) as the divisor.  \n\nThe misconception specifically involves inverting the roles of dividend and divisor during division, not merely selecting division over multiplication. Related misconceptions like \"divides rather than multiplies\" don't apply here, as division was required but executed incorrectly.  \n\nThe flaw directly aligns with misapplying division structure, where the quantity being divided (dividend) and the quantity dividing (divisor) are swapped.",
