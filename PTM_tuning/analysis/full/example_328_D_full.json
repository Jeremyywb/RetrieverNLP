  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Convert \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) to \\(\\frac{3}{9}\\)\n2. Add numerators: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n3. Result: \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n1. Multiplied numerators: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n2. Added denominators: \\(9 + 3 = 12\\)\n3. Simplified \\(\\frac{2}{12}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student treated addition as requiring multiplication of numerators and addition of denominators, violating the fundamental requirement to first align denominators. This directly stems from misunderstanding how fraction addition operates, where numerators are only combined after establishing equivalent denominators.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nUnlike simply adding numerators/denominators (which would yield \\(\\frac{3}{12}\\)), the student uniquely combined operations (multiplying numerators while adding denominators), indicating a more severe conflation of fraction operations.\n\nCore issue:\nThe error demonstrates a complete failure to recognize the need for common denominators, instead inventing an invalid hybrid operation that mixes multiplication and addition rules.",
