  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1) Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions:\n   \\( 1 \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\), \\( 3 \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\)\n2) Multiply: \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{11}{3} = \\frac{33}{6} = 5 \\frac{3}{6} \\)\n\nStudent's likely error:\n- Multiplied \\( 1 \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\) (whole number only) instead of \\( 1 \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\frac{2}{3} \\):\n   \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\times 3 = \\frac{9}{2} = 4 \\frac{3}{6} \\)\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student treated \\( 3 \\frac{2}{3} \\) as a whole number (3), omitting the fractional component entirely during multiplication. This corresponds directly to a failure to apply the full multiplication process to both parts of the mixed number. \n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis differs from \"adds instead of multiplies\" (which would produce a smaller result) or \"adds numerators/multiplies denominators\" (which would yield \\( \\frac{14}{5} \\)). The error specifically stems from excluding the fractional part of one mixed number during multiplication.",
