  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Sort the data \u2192 [-4, 3, 5, 6, 18, 18], take (5+6)/2 = 5.5.\n\nStudent's likely steps: Used original order [3, 5, 6, 18, 18, -4], took the 3rd and 4th numbers (6 and 18), calculated (6+18)/2 = 12.\n\nFlaw: The student failed to sort the dataset before identifying the middle values. This caused them to incorrectly select 6 and 18 as the \"middle\" numbers instead of 5 and 6. The error stems from not recognizing that median calculation requires ordered data to locate true central values.\n\nDistinction: Unlike finding the mean (which sums all values) or range midpoint (which averages extremes), this error specifically misapplies the median procedure by skipping the sorting step while still attempting to average two central positions. This aligns with misunderstanding how to identify the correct values to average in an even dataset.",
