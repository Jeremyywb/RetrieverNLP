  "explanation": "The correct calculation sums all frequency values: \\(6 + 7 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 21\\). \nThe student likely counted the number of rows in the table (5 unique goal values: 0-4) instead of summing frequencies. \nThis error stems from conflating the count of distinct data categories with the total observations. \nThe student treated each row as representing one match rather than interpreting the frequency column as counts per goal value. \nThis aligns with confusing table structure interpretation (counting rows) rather than incorrectly summing the goals column (which would produce \\(0+1+2+3+4=10\\)) or other listed misconceptions. \nThe key divergence was failing to recognize that frequencies represent multiple matches per goal category.",
