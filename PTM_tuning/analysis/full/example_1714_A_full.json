  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n\\(\\frac{6}{9} \\div 3 = \\frac{6}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6}{27} = \\frac{2}{9}\\).\n\nStudent's error: \nThey computed \\(\\frac{6}{9} \\div 3\\) as \\(\\frac{6}{3}\\).\n\nFlawed reasoning: \nThe student treated the division by 3 as an operation applied exclusively to the denominator of \\(\\frac{6}{9}\\), incorrectly calculating \\(9 \\div 3\\) instead of \\(9 \\times 3\\). This assumes division acts only on the denominator without affecting the entire fraction's value.\n\nMisconception link: \nThey failed to recognize that dividing a fraction by a whole number requires multiplying the denominator by that number (or equivalently, multiplying the fraction by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)). This directly stems from misapplying division to a component of the fraction rather than the entire quantity.\n\nDistinguishing from related errors: \nUnlike commutative division errors, this stems from incorrectly isolating parts of the fraction during division. It also differs from reciprocal errors, as the divisor here isn't a fraction.",
