  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n15\u00b2 = 225. The relationship requires \u25a1\u00b2 \u00d7 2 = 225. Solving \u25a1\u00b2 = 225/2 = 112.5 \u2192 \u25a1 = \u221a112.5 \u2248 10.6. However, the correct answer is 9, indicating a different valid relationship (e.g., \u25a1 = 9 produces \u25a1\u00b2 = 81, and 81 + 2\u2074 = 81 + 16 = 97, which doesn't align with 225. This suggests the problem's intended relationship might be \u25a1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = 15\u00b2 - 10\u00b2 = 225 - 100 = 125, but this is speculative. The exact correct relationship isn't clear, but the student's error remains identifiable.)\n\nStudent's error: \nStudent likely treated the merged cell as 15 (not 15\u00b2), then divided 15 by 2 to get 7.5. They then took the square root of 7.5 (\u22482.74) and rounded to 3. \n\nFlawed reasoning: \nThe student incorrectly operated on the base number (15) instead of maintaining the squared value (225) throughout calculations. They divided 15 by 2 before square-rooting, rather than preserving the exponent and solving \u25a1\u00b2 = 225/2. \n\nMisconception link: \nThis demonstrates confusion about preserving squared terms in equations. The student reduced 15\u00b2 to 15 prematurely, then applied division and square-rooting in the wrong order. \n\nDistinction from related errors: \nThis differs from \"confuses square rooting and halving\" because the error stems from mishandling exponents first, not conflating root/divide operations directly. The division occurred before addressing the square, whereas correct solving maintains the square until isolated.",
