  "explanation": "The correct setup aligns place values vertically:  \n128  \n\u00d7\u202f26  \n\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nwith 6 (ones) under 8 (ones) and 2 (tens) under 2 (tens). This preserves positional value for partial products.\n\nThe student decomposed both numbers into hundreds/tens/ones (128 \u2192 100+20+8) and tens/ones (26 \u2192 20+6), then aligned components horizontally:  \n100\u202f20\u202f8  \n\u202f\u202f20\u202f6  \n\nThis reflects a misapplication of the distributive property. By splitting both multiplicand and multiplier, they created separate component pairs (e.g., 100\u00d720, 20\u00d76) rather than maintaining 128 as a unified number to multiply by each digit of 26. The misconception stems from treating decomposition as independent horizontal alignment rather than vertical digit-by-digit multiplication. This directly connects to misunderstanding how the distributive property interacts with place value in standard algorithms, differing from related errors like left-starting alignment (which would preserve digit order but reverse multiplication steps).",
