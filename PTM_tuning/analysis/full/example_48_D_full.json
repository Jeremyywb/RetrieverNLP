  "explanation": "To find the input, reverse the operations: starting from 9a\u221221, divide by 3 (undoing \u00d73) to get 3a\u22127, then add 3 (undoing \u22123) to reach 3a\u22124. \n\nThe student likely divided 9a\u221221 by 3 correctly (3a\u22127) but stopped there, failing to add 3 afterward. \n\nThis shows they reversed the multiplication but neglected to reverse the subtraction step, treating the operations as isolated rather than sequential. \n\nThe error directly stems from not applying all inverse operations in reverse order. \n\nThis distinguishes from \"only applies one function\" because both operations were partially addressed, but the reversal sequence was incomplete. \n\nOther misconceptions like term-specific errors or commutative subtraction don't align, as the student correctly handled distribution in division.",
