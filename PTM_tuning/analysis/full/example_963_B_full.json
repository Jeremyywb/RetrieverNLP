  "explanation": "The correct calculation multiplies 72\u00d736 as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003432  (72\u00d76)\n\u2003+2160  (72\u00d730 shifted left)\n=2592\n\nThe student's work shows:\n\u2003\u2003432  \n\u2003+216  \n=648\n\nThe error occurs in the second multiplication step. The student correctly calculated 72\u00d76=432 but treated the tens digit multiplication as 72\u00d73=216 instead of 72\u00d730=2160. This shows a failure to recognize that the 3 in 36 represents 3 tens, requiring a place value shift. By omitting the zero placeholder (equivalent to not multiplying by 10), their second term became 10\u00d7 smaller than required. This matches the misconception of treating digits in other columns as units rather than accounting for their positional value. The error is distinct from general multiplication mistakes as it specifically involves place value handling, not arithmetic errors in the multiplication itself.",
