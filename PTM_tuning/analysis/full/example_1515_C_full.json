  "explanation": "The correct displacement-time graph shows three segments: positive slope (moving away), horizontal (rest), then negative slope (returning home). The negative slope must be steeper than the initial positive slope because running speed > walking speed.\n\nThe student's graph incorrectly uses a positive slope for the return journey. They likely understood that steeper slope = higher speed but failed to recognize displacement decreases when returning. This indicates they didn't connect the slope's **sign** to directionality in displacement-time graphs.\n\nThe error stems from treating displacement as a distance-like scalar quantity, where movement in any direction increases distance. However, displacement is vectorial: returning reduces displacement, requiring a negative slope. The student\u2019s misconception conflated displacement\u2019s vector properties with distance\u2019s scalar behavior, leading them to maintain a positive slope for the return trip.\n\nThis distinguishes from the related misconception about gradient steepness vs. speed, as the student correctly associated steeper = faster but misapplied directionality. The core flaw was not recognizing displacement\u2019s directional dependence, not a confusion with velocity-time graphs.",
