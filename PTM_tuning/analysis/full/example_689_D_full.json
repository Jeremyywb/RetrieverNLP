  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n10 = 5/p  \nMultiply both sides by p: 10p = 5  \nDivide by 10: p = 0.5\n\nStudent's likely incorrect reasoning:\nAttempted to clear the fraction but only multiplied the right side by p:  \n10 = (5/p) * p \u2192 10 = 5  \nConcluded \"10=5\" is impossible, leading to \"no solutions\"\n\nSpecific flaw: The student failed to multiply *both sides* by p when eliminating the denominator. This caused them to alter only the right side, creating a false contradiction. The error stems from not recognizing that multiplying by a variable requires maintaining equality through equal operations on both sides. This directly aligns with the primary misconception about improper fraction elimination, distinct from fraction inversion or division errors (which would yield numerical errors, not \"no solution\").",
