  "explanation": "Correct calculation requires determining which angles are equal:\n- If 56\u00b0 is the unique angle: 2p = 180 - 56 \u2192 p = 62\u00b0\n- If 56\u00b0 is a base angle: p = 180 - 2\u00d756 = 68\u00b0 (or p could be another base angle = 56\u00b0)\n\nThe student likely:\n1. Assumed the triangle has exactly two 56\u00b0 angles (without verifying which angles are equal)\n2. Concluded p = 56\u00b0 by mirroring the given angle\n\nThis error stems from assuming the labeled angles must be the equal pair in an isosceles triangle, rather than recognizing the 56\u00b0 angle could be either the unique angle or one of two equal angles. The student copied the given angle value without considering positional ambiguity of p or verifying angle relationships through the 180\u00b0 sum. This specifically matches the \"copies given angles\" misconception rather than general triangle sum neglect, as their work shows awareness of angle equality (selecting 56\u00b0 as a match) but fails to validate its role in the triangle's structure.",
