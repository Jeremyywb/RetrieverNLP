This occurred because they treated the inequality as an equation that must have the variable on the left, incorrectly flipping the direction without mathematical justification. The reversal happened during final presentation, not during operations with negative coefficients. This differs from related errors like sign-related reversals during division/multiplication, as all steps here used positive numbers. The error stems from misinterpreting inequality notation conventions rather than algebraic manipulation rules.",
