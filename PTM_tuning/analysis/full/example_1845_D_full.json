  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Tom: \u221a16 = 4; \u221a9 = 3 \u2192 4+3=7 (incorrect)\n- Katie: \u221a(16+9) = \u221a25 =5 (correct)\n\nStudent's error:\n- Mistakenly concluded \u221a16+\u221a9 \u22605 (correct) AND \u221a(16+9)\u22605 (incorrect)\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student likely recognized Tom's error (4+3\u22605) but incorrectly rejected Katie's valid calculation. They failed to compute \u221a(16+9)=\u221a25=5, possibly believing the sum inside the radical prevents valid simplification. This aligns with dismissing both methods rather than miscalculating operations. It differs from related misconceptions about squaring/doubling because the error stems from invalidating correct methodology rather than arithmetic mistakes.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nNo evidence suggests confusion with squaring/doubling or negative roots. The core issue is rejecting valid square root properties in both approaches despite Katie's method working.",
