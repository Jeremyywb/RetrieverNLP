  "explanation": "The correct interpretation recognizes \\(p-3 \\equiv -(3-p)\\) as an identity because both sides are equivalent for all values of \\(p\\), demonstrated by algebraic simplification to \\(p-3 = p-3\\). \n\nThe student classified it as a \"formula,\" likely because they interpreted the equation as a general mathematical relationship (e.g., \\(F=ma\\)) without recognizing the universal equivalence implied by the \\(\\equiv\\) symbol. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the term \"formula\" to a statement of equivalence, conflating structural similarity with purpose. The student focused on the equation's form (two expressions related by an equals sign) rather than its inherent meaning (identical truth across all inputs). \n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception of emphasizing form over meaning, as opposed to related errors like confusing equations with identities (which would involve misinterpreting conditional vs. universal validity). The student\u2019s reasoning did not distinguish between a formula\u2019s role as a derived relationship and an identity\u2019s role as an unconditional equivalence.",
