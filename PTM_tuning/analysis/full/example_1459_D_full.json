  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n0.6 \u00d7 11 = (6 \u00d7 11)/10 = 66/10 = 6.6\n\nStudent's error:\n66 (equivalent to 6 \u00d7 11)\n\nThe student treated 0.6 as 6 instead of 6 tenths. They multiplied the digits directly (6\u00d711=66) without adjusting for the original decimal's place value. This shows they failed to recognize that multiplying by a decimal requires preserving the fractional relationship through division by the appropriate power of 10.\n\nThis matches \"ignores place value\" because they handled 0.6 as a whole number rather than maintaining its tenths unit. It's distinct from \"divides by wrong power\" since there's no evidence they attempted any division at all - the decimal was entirely disregarded.\n\nThe error isn't about misplacing the decimal after correct multiplication (which would align with \"forgets to move\"), but rather a fundamental failure to acknowledge the decimal's existence during the multiplication process.",
