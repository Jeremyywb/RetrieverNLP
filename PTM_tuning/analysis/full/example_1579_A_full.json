  "explanation": "Correct calculation: At 10:15, the graph shows Rachel at 6.5 km from home (midpoint between 6 km at 10:00 and 7 km at 10:30). Converting km to meters: \\(6.5 \\times 1000 = 6500\\) m.\n\nStudent's error: The student wrote \\(6.5\\) m instead of km, directly using the numerical value from the graph's scale without unit conversion. This indicates they interpreted the y-axis labels as meters instead of kilometers, despite the axis explicitly stating \"(Km).\"\n\nSpecific flaw: The student failed to process the unit label on the y-axis, treating kilometers as meters. This caused them to omit the required multiplication by 1000 for unit conversion.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: Unlike errors involving misreading scale increments (e.g., assuming squares represent 10 units), this error stems from disregarding the axis' stated unit entirely, not misinterpreting its subdivisions.\n\nThe misconception directly links to the unit oversight: reading \"Km\" as meters negated the need for conversion, collapsing 6.5 km to 6.5 m. Related scale misinterpretations (e.g., 100m vs. km) would involve partial conversions, not a complete unit substitution.",
