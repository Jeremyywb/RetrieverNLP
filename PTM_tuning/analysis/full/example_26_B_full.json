  "explanation": "The correct equation uses the radius squared: \\(4^2 = 16\\) because the circle passes through \\((4,0)\\), indicating radius 4. \n\nThe student likely identified the radius as 4 but incorrectly wrote \\(\\sqrt{4}\\) instead of \\(4^2\\). \n\nThis shows they confused squaring the radius (required in the circle equation) with taking its square root. \n\nThe misconception directly substitutes the radius \\(r\\) with \\(\\sqrt{r}\\) instead of \\(r^2\\), mistaking the operation needed for the standard form equation. \n\nThis differs from halving/doubling errors because no arithmetic manipulation of the radius value occurred - the error purely stems from misapplying the exponent operation.",
