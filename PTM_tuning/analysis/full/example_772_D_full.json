  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Multiply 3 (from 0.03) by 12: \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\)\n- Apply decimal places: 0.03 has 2 decimal places \u2192 \\(36 \\div 100 = 0.36\\)\n\nStudent's error:\n- Calculated \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\)\n- Applied only 1 decimal place adjustment: \\(36 \\div 10 = 3.6\\)\n\nThe student correctly multiplied the digits but misapplied the decimal placement. Since 0.03 has two decimal places, the product must be divided by \\(10^2\\). The error stems from using \\(10^1\\) instead, reducing the division by one power of 10. This matches the \"divides by wrong power\" misconception, not \"ignores place value\" (which would yield 36) or \"multiplies when reinserting\" (which would produce 3600).",
