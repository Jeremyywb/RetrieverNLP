  "explanation": "The correct answer requires recognizing \\(8 = 2^3\\). The student selected 15, likely reasoning: \"A cube number is made by multiplying a number by 3. If I take 5 and multiply by 3, I get \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).\" \n\nThis error stems from interpreting \"cubing\" as multiplication by 3 rather than \\(n \\times n \\times n\\). The student misapplied the operation by replacing exponentiation with linear scaling. \n\nThis aligns with the misconception that cubing means multiplying by 3, not the related confusion with multiples of 3 (which would include numbers like 6 or 9) or triangular numbers (which 15 technically is, but the error mechanism here is operational, not geometric). The direct substitution of multiplication for exponentiation distinguishes this from other listed misconceptions.",
