  "explanation": "The correct first step requires expressing both fractions with the common denominator \\( x(x-2) \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{x-2} \\cdot \\frac{x}{x} - \\frac{5}{x} \\cdot \\frac{x-2}{x-2} = \\frac{3x}{x(x-2)} - \\frac{5(x-2)}{x(x-2)}.\n\\]\nThe student incorrectly wrote \\( 9x - 5(x-2) \\), omitting the denominator entirely. \n\nTheir error stems from treating the numerators as standalone terms to be combined by cross-multiplication (multiplying \\( 3 \\) by \\( x \\) and \\( 5 \\) by \\( x-2 \\)), then subtracting, without establishing a common denominator. This reflects a failure to recognize that fractions must share a common denominator before their numerators can be combined. \n\nThe arithmetic mistake (\\( 3 \\cdot x = 9x \\)) is secondary, but the core flaw is the absence of a unified denominator. This distinguishes the error from misconceptions about grouping or order of operations, as the student focused solely on manipulating numerators without addressing the denominators.",
