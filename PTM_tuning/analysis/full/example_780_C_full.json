  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes that a rhombus is defined by having four equal sides, while an arrowhead (concave kite) has two pairs of adjacent equal sides but not all four equal. The student incorrectly assumed both shapes satisfy the four-equal-sides condition. \n\nThe error stems from conflating quadrilaterals with different side-length properties due to insufficient distinction between their defining characteristics. Specifically, the student failed to recognize that \"four equal sides\" exclusively defines a rhombus within standard quadrilateral classifications. \n\nThis aligns with a misunderstanding of hierarchical relationships: the student treated arrowheads and rhombuses as interchangeable under a vague \"four-sided shape\" umbrella rather than adhering to strict definitions. \n\nThis explanation better fits than angle-related misconceptions, as the question centers on side equality. Similarly, curved sides or perpendicular adjacent sides (irrelevant to arrowheads) are not factors here. The core issue is misapplying the side-length criteria to an incompatible shape.",
