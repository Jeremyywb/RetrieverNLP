  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- 4 + 10 = 14\n- 10 + 14 = 24\n- Each term is the sum of its two predecessors\n\nStudent's incorrect application:\n- 4 \u2192 10: (4\u00d72)+2=10 (correct)\n- 10 \u2192 14: (10\u00d72)+2=22\u226014 (invalid)\n- Mistakenly assumes rule works for all transitions\n\nFlaw: The student derived a rule that matched the first transition but didn't verify consistency with subsequent terms. They prioritized pattern-matching for isolated terms over testing recurrence relations across the full sequence.\n\nConnection: The error stems from validating the rule only for the first term pair, then ignoring contradictions in later terms. This matches the \"applies one step per term\" misconception.\n\nDistinction: Unlike linear sequence errors, the student recognized nonlinearity but failed to check multi-term dependencies. The error isn't about arithmetic definitions but partial pattern enforcement.",
