  "explanation": "The correct gradient calculation uses the two points on the tangent: (8,51) and (0,40). The slope is (51 - 40)/(8 - 0) = 11/8 = 1.375. \n\nThe student likely computed 51/8 directly (51 \u00f7 8 = 6.375), treating the single point's y-coordinate as the \"change in y\" and its x-coordinate as the \"change in x\". \n\nThis error stems from conflating the formula for slope (\u0394y/\u0394x) with the ratio of a single point's coordinates (y/x). The student incorrectly assumed the gradient equals the point's y-value divided by its x-value, bypassing the need for two distinct points. \n\nThis aligns with the misconception that gradient = y/x at a point, not \u0394y/\u0394x between points. It differs from related errors like misreading graph values or using origin-based \u0394y, as the tangent explicitly passes through (0,40), which was ignored in favor of the (8,51) point alone.",
