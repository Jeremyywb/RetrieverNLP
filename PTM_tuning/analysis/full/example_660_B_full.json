  "explanation": "To find the gradient of \\( 5x + 3y = 7 \\), we solve for \\( y \\):\n\\[ 3y = -5x + 7 \\]\n\\[ y = -\\frac{5}{3}x + \\frac{7}{3} \\]\nThe gradient is the coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( -\\frac{5}{3} \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly identified \\(-5\\) as the gradient. This suggests they took the coefficient of \\( x \\) directly from the original equation \\( 5x + 3y = 7 \\), without isolating \\( y \\). The error stems from assuming the gradient equals the \\( x \\)-coefficient in any linear equation, regardless of its form. This directly matches the listed primary misconception (belief that the coefficient represents the gradient even when not in \\( y = mx + c \\) form). \n\nThe error is distinct from algebraic mistakes in solving for \\( y \\), as no intermediate steps were attempted. Unlike \"variable on both sides\" issues, the student disregarded the need to isolate \\( y \\) entirely.",
