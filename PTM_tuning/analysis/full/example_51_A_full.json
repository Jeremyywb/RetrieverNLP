  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n400\u00d76 = 2400  \n20\u00d76 = 120  \n7\u00d76 = 42  \nTotal: 2400 + 120 + 42  \n\nStudent's calculation:  \n400\u00d76 = 240 (incorrect)  \n20\u00d76 = 120  \n7\u00d76 = 42  \nTotal: 240 + 120 + 42  \n\nThe student treated 400\u00d76 as 40\u00d76=240, truncating the hundreds place. This shows they failed to preserve the full place value when multiplying the hundreds digit. The error stems from treating \"400\" as \"40\" during calculation, reducing the magnitude by a factor of 10. This matches a misunderstanding of how place value scales multiplication results, distinct from carrying errors or zero-adding habits. The error occurs at the initial multiplication step, not during digit carrying or partial-sum aggregation. Related misconceptions about carrying digits don't apply here, as no regrouping was required for 400\u00d76.",
