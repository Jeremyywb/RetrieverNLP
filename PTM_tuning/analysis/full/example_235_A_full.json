  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \nTotal counters = 10  \nGreen counters = 10 - 3 - 3 = 4  \nProbability = \\(\\frac{4}{10}\\)\n\nStudent's error:  \nThey wrote \"4\" instead of \\(\\frac{4}{10}\\).  \n\nThe student correctly calculated the number of green counters (4) but treated this count as the probability itself, omitting the denominator. Probability requires expressing the favorable outcomes as a fraction of the total possible outcomes. This shows they conflated the absolute frequency (number of green counters) with the probability, which is a ratio.  \n\nThis error aligns with the misconception of giving a frequency when asked for relative frequency (probability), not merely forgetting to simplify or reversing numerator/denominator. The integer answer confirms they didn\u2019t recognize the need to relate the count to the total sample space.",
