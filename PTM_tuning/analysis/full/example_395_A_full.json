  "explanation": "The correct calculations are:\n- Tom: \\( 3 \\times (-6) = -18 \\)\n- Katie: \\( \\frac{(-18)}{3} = -6 \\)\n\nThe student likely reasoned:\n- Recognized Tom's multiplication correctly accounts for the negative result (-18) by multiplying 3 (positive) and -6 (negative).\n- Evaluated Katie's division as \\( \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\), ignoring the negative sign in -18, then assumed the answer should be positive. This led them to reject Katie's correct negative result (-6).\n\nThe flaw stems from disregarding the negative sign in the dividend (-18) during division. This caused the student to miscalculate \\( \\frac{(-18)}{3} \\) as positive 6 instead of -6, invalidating Katie's answer. The error aligns with a failure to apply the rule that dividing a negative by a positive yields a negative, distinct from misconceptions about sign interactions in multiplication or division between two negatives. The student\u2019s focus on preserving negativity in multiplication but not in division highlights the specific oversight.",
