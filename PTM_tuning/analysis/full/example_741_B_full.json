  "explanation": "The correct analysis recognizes that \"6-3g=3\" contains an equality symbol (=), making it an equation (a statement of equality between two expressions). The student incorrectly classified it as an expression, which lacks an equality symbol. Their reasoning likely focused only on the presence of variables and arithmetic operations in \"6-3g\", while failing to recognize that the entire structure \"6-3g=3\" constitutes an equation due to the equality assertion. This directly stems from misunderstanding how equality symbols define equations versus standalone expressions. The error is distinct from confusing equations with identities (which require universal truth) or misclassifying variables, as the core issue is the fundamental definition of an equation versus expression.",
