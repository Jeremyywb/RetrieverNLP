  "explanation": "The correct reflection requires each point in the figure to be mirrored across the diagonal line. For example, a point at coordinates (a,b) relative to the diagonal mirror line would map to (b,a). The student\u2019s answer likely preserved the original orientation (e.g., maintaining left/right or up/down relationships) instead of swapping coordinates relative to the diagonal. \n\nThis error stems from treating the reflection as a vertical/horizontal flip rather than a diagonal one. The student applied symmetry relative to an axis aligned with their mental \"default\" (vertical/horizontal) instead of the actual diagonal mirror line. This directly corresponds to a failure to adjust the reflection axis to the problem\u2019s specified line, distinguishing it from a general inability to visualize transformations or recognize flipping. The error is axis-specific, not a complete lack of reflection understanding.",
