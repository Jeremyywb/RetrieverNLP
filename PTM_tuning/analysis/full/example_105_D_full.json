  "explanation": "The correct solution recognizes that vertically opposite angles formed by intersecting straight lines are equal. Since \\( p \\) is opposite the marked \\( 42^\\circ \\) angle, \\( p = 42^\\circ \\). The student's claim of \"not enough information\" suggests they either doubted the lines were straight or failed to identify vertical angles. \n\nThe error stems from not applying the vertical angles property, likely due to uncertainty about the lines' straightness or the relationship itself. This aligns with the primary misconception, as the problem's diagram (standard intersecting lines) inherently assumes straightness. \n\nThe student did not confuse vertical angles with supplementary angles (as \\( 138^\\circ + 42^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\) correctly shows a straight line) or angles around a point, which distinguishes this from related misconceptions. Their reasoning halted at the assumption that critical geometric properties could not be applied without explicit confirmation.",
