  "explanation": "The correct answer requires recognizing that a parallelogram (order 2) has higher rotational symmetry than irregular quadrilaterals (order 1) but lower than a square (order 4). The student's claim that \"they each have the same order\" implies they assumed rotational symmetry depends solely on being quadrilaterals (4-sided), ignoring shape-specific properties. This aligns with the misconception that rotational symmetry order is determined by vertex count alone, not shape regularity or symmetry features. The error stems from failing to compare rotational symmetry across different quadrilaterals (e.g., squares vs. trapezoids). This differs from related errors like miscounting symmetry order (e.g., confusing order 2 with 3) or misunderstanding \"regular\" shapes, as the error here is a generalization across all quadrilaterals rather than a specific counting mistake.",
