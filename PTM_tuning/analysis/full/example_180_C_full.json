  "explanation": "The correct reflection would mirror the upper figure across the red horizontal line below it, creating a symmetrical bottom half. The student's answer likely shows a vertical reflection (e.g., flipping left/right instead of top/bottom) or misaligned positioning relative to the mirror line. \n\nThis error stems from treating the horizontal symmetry line as a vertical axis, causing incorrect directional flipping. Coordinates were transformed as if reflecting over a vertical line (changing x-values) rather than a horizontal line (changing y-values). \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of reflecting over an unintended axis rather than the specified mirror line. It differs from \"partially reflects the shape,\" as the entire figure was mirrored but in the wrong orientation, and from \"line must touch the shape,\" as the line's position was correctly applied but misinterpreted geometrically.",
