  "explanation": "Correct approach: In a general quadrilateral, angle measures cannot be determined from one given angle. The sum of all angles equals 360\u00b0, but three unknown angles remain unconstrained with only one angle measure provided.\n\nStudent's likely calculation: \\( p = 180\u00b0 - 130\u00b0 = 50\u00b0 \\), assuming two opposite angles must sum to 180\u00b0.\n\nFlaw: The student incorrectly applied the cyclic quadrilateral property (opposite angles supplementary) without justification that the quadrilateral is cyclic. This single unverified assumption created an apparent solution where none exists.\n\nDistinction: This differs from co-interior angle errors (which require parallel lines) or arbitrary number selection. The systematic application of a specific geometric rule in an invalid context matches the opposite angle sum misconception precisely.\n\nThe error stems from overextending a special-case quadrilateral property to all quadrilaterals, bypassing the need for verification of cyclic conditions.",
