  "explanation": "The correct algebraic representation for multiplying \\( m \\) three times is \\( m^3 \\), using exponent notation to denote repeated multiplication.\n\nThe student wrote \\( \\mathrm{mmm} \\), concatenating the variable three times without exponents. This indicates they interpreted \"multiplied by\" literally as sequential placement of the variable, rather than recognizing the need to express repeated multiplication through exponents.\n\nThe error stems from misapplying arithmetic conventions (where digits are concatenated for place value) to algebraic terms. The student treated \\( m \\) as a digit to be repeated (e.g., \\( 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\) written as \"333\"), failing to distinguish between numeric digit concatenation and algebraic multiplication rules.\n\nThis aligns with the misconception of writing variables next to each other to denote multiplication without transitioning to exponential form. It differs from related misconceptions like omitting multiplication symbols (e.g., writing \\( m \\times m \\times m \\) as \\( mmm \\)), as the student's error specifically conflates concatenation with multiplication notation rather than misunderstanding symbol omission.",
