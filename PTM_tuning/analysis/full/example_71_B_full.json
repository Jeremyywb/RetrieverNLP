  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The height at 20 seconds is 30m. At 50 seconds (interpolated between (40,50) and (60,60)), the height is 55m. The difference is 55m - 30m = 25m.\n\nStudent's likely error: They added the height at 20 seconds (30m) to the height at 50 seconds (55m), resulting in 30 + 55 = 85m.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the problem as requiring a total sum of heights rather than computing the net change. This reflects a misinterpretation of \"how many metres did the rocket travel\" as cumulative addition of positions, not recognizing it refers to displacement between two points.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly stems from conflating total accumulation with difference calculation, despite the question explicitly involving a time interval. This aligns with the primary misconception of using summation when subtraction is required.\n\nDistinguishing factors: The error isn't about misreading axes (values are correctly extracted) or using wrong data points (30m and 55m are valid for 20s and 50s). The core issue is misapplying arithmetic operation due to misinterpreted problem phrasing.",
