  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n23.04 \u00f7 1000 requires moving the decimal three places left:  \n23.04 \u2192 2.304 (1 place) \u2192 0.2304 (2 places) \u2192 0.02304 (3 places).\n\nStudent's error:\nThe answer 0.0002304 implies moving the decimal five places left instead of three:  \n23.04 \u2192 0.0002304 (5 shifts).\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student likely added the number of whole-number digits (2 in \"23\") to the required three-place shift for 1000, resulting in an extra two moves. This conflates the division process with the original number's digit count, overextending the decimal shift.\n\nMisconception link:\nThis directly corresponds to moving the decimal too far left, as the error stems from misapplying the relationship between the divisor's magnitude and decimal placement. It isn't a misunderstanding of placeholder zeros or fractional division, as the shift distance itself is miscalculated.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike errors involving fractional place values or zero placement, this mistake specifically misjudges the required shift magnitude by conflating it with unrelated digit counts in the original number.",
