  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n(2/3 + 1/6 - 1/3 + 5/6) k\u00b2  \n= (4/6 + 1/6 - 2/6 + 5/6) k\u00b2  \n= (8/6) k\u00b2  \n= 1 1/3 k\u00b2\n\nStudent's calculation:\nCombined 2/3 k\u00b2 -1/3 k\u00b2 = 1/3 k\u00b2 and 1/6 k\u00b2 +5/6 k\u00b2 = k\u00b2, then stopped here.\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student correctly combined terms in pairs but failed to recognize that the resulting 1/3 k\u00b2 and k\u00b2 are still like terms requiring full simplification. The misconception caused them to treat intermediate results as final terms rather than recognizing all k\u00b2 terms must merge into a single coefficient. This aligns with partial simplification rather than fraction errors, as their pairwise additions were mathematically correct but incomplete. The error stems from misunderstanding that \"simplify fully\" requires eliminating all reducible terms, not just obvious pairs.",
