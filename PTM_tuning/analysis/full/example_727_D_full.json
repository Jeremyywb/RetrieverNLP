  "explanation": "Correct calculation: For input 4: (4 + 5) \u00d7 2 = 18. For input 9: (9 + 5) \u00d7 2 = 28.\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: For input 4: (4 \u00f7 2) - 5 = -3. For input 9: (9 \u00f7 2) - 5 = -0.5.\n\nThe student reversed the order of operations and used inverses (division instead of multiplication, subtraction instead of addition) instead of applying the given operations sequentially. This occurred because they misinterpreted the function machine's directionality, treating the output calculation as requiring inverse operations to \"undo\" a result rather than applying the listed transformations forward. The error matches the misconception of applying inverse operations when direct operations are required, distinct from merely confusing operation order or misplacing inputs. Their calculation sequence directly contradicts the machine's defined flow (add then double), but aligns with reversing those steps.",
