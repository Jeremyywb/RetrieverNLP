  "explanation": "The correct answer requires recognizing that all shapes (A, B, C) have at least one line of symmetry. The trapezium (A) has vertical symmetry, the sector-removed circle (B) has symmetry along the bisector of the missing sector, and the crescent (C) typically has vertical symmetry in its standard representation.\n\nThe student likely correctly identified symmetry in the trapezium but failed to analyze B and C. They might have assumed B (partial circle) lacks symmetry due to the missing sector, not realizing the remaining arc still allows symmetry through the angle bisector of the gap. Similarly, they may have perceived the crescent as asymmetric without considering its mirrored curves.\n\nThis error directly stems from an inability to identify non-obvious mirror lines in irregular shapes. The student focused on surface features (e.g., \"incomplete\" circle) rather than geometric relationships, unlike the related misconception about vertical/horizontal lines alone - B's symmetry could be diagonal, but the core issue was failing to recognize any line in B/C at all.\n\nThe misconception manifests as stopping at the first valid symmetry (A) without systematically testing all options, conflating visual irregularity with asymmetry. This differs from rectangle diagonal symmetry errors, as no diagonals are involved here.",
