  "explanation": "The correct calculation converts fractions to have a common denominator: \n\\(\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{12}{15}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{15}\\), resulting in \\(\\frac{12}{15} - \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nThe student likely converted \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) to \\(\\frac{12}{15}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) to \\(\\frac{5}{15}\\) correctly but then added the numerators: \\(12 + 5 = 17\\), leading to \\(\\frac{17}{15}\\).\n\nThe error stems from treating the subtraction operation as addition after finding equivalent fractions. The student applied the correct initial step of common denominators but failed to execute subtraction on the numerators, instead summing them. \n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception of adding instead of subtracting, as the error occurred during the operation step despite proper fraction conversion. It is distinct from \"ignores the negative sign\" because there is no explicit negative value here, and from word-problem confusion since the operation is explicitly stated. \n\nThe specific flaw is the misapplication of the arithmetic operation after correctly preparing the fractions, directly linking to the core misconception of substituting addition for subtraction.",
