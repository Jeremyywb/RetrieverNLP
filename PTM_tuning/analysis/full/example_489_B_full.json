  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n- Area = side\u00b2 \u2192 side = \u221a64 = 8 cm\n\nStudent's likely steps: \n- Incorrectly associated area with 4\u00d7side \u2192 64 \u00f7 4 = 16 cm\n\nSpecific flaw: \nThe student treated area as a linear measurement divided equally among four sides, applying perimeter logic (where perimeter = 4\u00d7side) to an area problem. This caused them to divide 64 by 4 instead of taking the square root.\n\nConnection to misconception: \nThey confused the formula for area (s\u00b2) with perimeter (4s), misapplying division by 4 to reverse a squaring operation.\n\nDistinction from related errors: \nThis isn't a simple arithmetic error (e.g., 64\u00f72=32) or confusion about square root notation \u2013 the error specifically substitutes multiplication by 4 for exponentiation in the area formula.",
