  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n\\( \\frac{(-3) \\times (-2)}{-0.2} = \\frac{6}{-0.2} = -30 \\).  \nThis requires recognizing that dividing by 0.2 is equivalent to multiplying by \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\), then applying the sign.\n\nStudent's likely steps:  \n1. Correctly computed \\( (-3) \\times (-2) = 6 \\).  \n2. Divided \\( 6 \\div (-0.2) \\) as \\( 6 \\div (-2) = -3 \\).  \n\nFlaw:  \nThe student treated \\( -0.2 \\) as \\( -2 \\), ignoring the decimal place. Dividing by \\( 0.2 \\) requires multiplying by \\( 10 \\) (to convert \\( 0.2 \\rightarrow 2 \\)), then dividing by \\( 2 \\). The student omitted the \\( \\times 10 \\) adjustment, effectively dividing by \\( 2 \\) instead of \\( 0.2 \\), reducing the result by a factor of 10.  \n\nDistinction:  \nThis error specifically stems from mishandling decimal division scaling, not from misordering operations (commutativity) or combining operations incorrectly. The student adjusted the divisor's magnitude improperly, not its position in the expression.",
