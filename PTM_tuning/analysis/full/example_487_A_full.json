  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the rectangle's perimeter formula: \\(2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) = 1.6\\ \\mathrm{m}\\). Given one side as \\(0.35\\ \\mathrm{m}\\) (width), the two widths total \\(0.70\\ \\mathrm{m}\\). Subtracting from the perimeter: \\(1.6 - 0.70 = 0.90\\ \\mathrm{m}\\) for the two lengths, so one length is \\(0.90 / 2 = 0.45\\ \\mathrm{m}\\).\n\nThe student likely subtracted \\(0.35\\ \\mathrm{m}\\) directly from \\(1.6\\ \\mathrm{m}\\), calculating \\(1.6 - 0.35 = 1.25\\ \\mathrm{m}\\). This ignores that rectangles have two pairs of equal sides. By failing to double the given width before subtracting, the student treated the perimeter as a single pair of sides rather than both pairs. This aligns with the misconception of adding only one pair of opposite sides, not recognizing the need to account for all four sides. It differs from general misconceptions about rectangle properties, as the error specifically stems from mishandling the additive structure of the perimeter.",
