  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Both problems require multiplying 17 \u00d7 32. For Problem 1, \"product\" directly indicates multiplication. For Problem 2, the total art is calculated as 17 groups of 32, which also requires multiplication.\n\nIncorrect reasoning: The student likely recognized Problem 1's use of \"product\" as signaling multiplication but did not connect the term to Problem 2's context. They assumed multiplication was only needed when the word \"product\" was explicitly stated.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student restricted multiplication to problems containing the term \"product\" rather than understanding it as a general operation for combining equal groups. This limited their ability to identify multiplicative relationships in word problems.\n\nMisconception link: Not knowing \"product\" universally signifies multiplication led the student to overlook its application in Problem 2. They treated \"product\" as a keyword rather than a mathematical concept.\n\nDistinguishing from related errors: Unlike errors involving substituting addition/subtraction, this stems from a narrow association of multiplication with specific terminology rather than conceptual misunderstanding of grouping.",
