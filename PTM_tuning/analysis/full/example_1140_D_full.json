  "explanation": "The correct area calculation is \\(5\\,\\text{cm} \\times 12\\,\\text{cm} = 60\\,\\text{cm}^2\\). The student likely concluded that side lengths alone were insufficient to compute the area, possibly because they misapplied the concept of dimension requirements. \n\nA rectangle's area requires only two adjacent side lengths, but the student may have incorrectly assumed the given values represented non-adjacent sides, diagonals, or that additional parameters (like angles) were needed. This directly stems from a failure to connect the provided numerical values to the standard area formula for rectangles. \n\nThe error is distinct from confusion about distance calculations (which would involve perimeter) or total misunderstanding of the question, as the student recognized the problem involved area but misjudged the sufficiency of given data. The core issue was misidentifying which properties define a rectangle's area, not a lack of formula knowledge or diagram dependency.",
