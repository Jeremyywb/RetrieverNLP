  "explanation": "The correct identification requires recognizing that lines intersecting at 90\u00b0 (as shown in the image) are perpendicular, which involves understanding their slopes multiply to -1. The student labeled them \"parallel\" instead. \n\nThe error stems from conflating two distinct geometric relationships. The student likely observed the intersection but misapplied the term \"parallel\" (which requires identical slopes and no intersection) to a scenario involving intersection at right angles. \n\nThis directly matches the confusion between parallel/perpendicular terminology rather than a slope calculation error or failure to recognize equal gradients. The error isn't about axis alignment (since perpendicular lines can exist at any orientation) or total unfamiliarity with \"parallel\" (as they used the term, just incorrectly). The core issue is swapping the definitions of these specific terms when interpreting the visual.",
