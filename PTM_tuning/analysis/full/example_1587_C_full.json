  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- 5 dashes create 4 equal intervals between 1/5 and 3/5\n- Total span = 3/5 - 1/5 = 2/5\n- Interval size = (2/5) \u00f7 4 = 1/10\n- 4th dash value = 1/5 + 3*(1/10) = 5/10 = 1/2\n\nStudent's likely error:\n- Treated the 5 dashes as 5 equal parts rather than 4 intervals\n- Assigned denominator as 4 (number of parts between start and arrow)\n- Calculated: 4th dash = 3/4 (numerator=position count, denominator=perceived divisions)\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student incorrectly used the dash count (5) to determine divisions rather than interval count (4). This caused them to divide the span into 4 parts instead of 4 intervals, mapping position 4/4 to the arrow. This directly matches counting points (dashes) as quantity markers rather than measuring spaces between them.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\n- Not an estimation error: 3/4 exceeds the given range (1/5 to 3/5), ruling out visual guessing\n- Not equivalent fractions issue: Error stems from division count, not scaling fractions",
