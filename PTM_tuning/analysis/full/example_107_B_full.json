  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 15 \\div \\frac{3}{5} = 15 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{75}{3} = 25 \\).\n\nStudent's likely steps: \\( 15 \\times 5 = 75 \\), omitting division by 3.\n\nThe error occurred when dividing by \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\). The student multiplied 15 by the denominator (5) but failed to divide by the numerator (3). This stems from misapplying fraction division as multiplying by the denominator alone, rather than the reciprocal. The misconception specifically involves treating division as multiplication by the denominator without properly accounting for the numerator. This differs from inverting the wrong fraction (e.g., flipping \\(15\\) instead of \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\)) or skipping reciprocal steps entirely. The student's partial application of the reciprocal operation directly caused the inflated result.",
