  "explanation": "Correct approach: A triangle's angles sum to 180\u00b0, making two right angles impossible (90+90=180 leaves no third angle). Right triangles can be scalene (3-4-5) or isosceles (1-1-\u221a2), disproving Katie's claim.\n\nStudent's error: Accepted Katie's statement because they likely thought \"scalene\" and \"right-angled\" are mutually exclusive categories. This stems from misunderstanding that right triangles are classified by angles while scalene/isosceles are defined by sides - these properties can coexist independently.\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student assumed \"only scalene\" implies right angles require unequal sides, not recognizing that right triangles can have two equal sides (isosceles right triangles). This directly connects to confusing triangle classification systems - mistaking side-length categories (scalene) for angle-type requirements (right).\n\nDistinction: While \"isosceles cannot have right angles\" is another misconception, this error specifically shows inability to separate side-based and angle-based classifications, not just ignorance of isosceles right triangles.\n\nThe misconception manifests as treating \"scalene\" as a requirement for right angles rather than an independent property, leading to false validation of Katie's claim.",
