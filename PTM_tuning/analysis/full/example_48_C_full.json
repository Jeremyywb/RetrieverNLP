  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Start with output: \\(9a - 21\\)\n2. Reverse last operation (\\(\\times 3\\)) by dividing: \\(\\frac{9a - 21}{3} = 3a - 7\\)\n3. Reverse first operation (\\(-3\\)) by adding: \\(3a - 7 + 3 = 3a - 4\\)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n1. Divided only the first term: \\(\\frac{9a}{3} = 3a\\)\n2. Left the second term unchanged: \\(-21\\)\n3. Combined results: \\(3a - 21\\)\n\nSpecific flaw: The student divided only the first term (\\(9a\\)) by 3 but failed to divide the second term (\\(-21\\)) by 3. This reflects a failure to apply the inverse operation uniformly to all terms in the expression. The error matches the misconception of applying operations selectively to individual terms rather than the entire expression. \n\nDistinguishing from related errors: Unlike order-of-operations reversals (which would yield \\(3a - 6\\)), this error specifically shows partial term-wise application. The student recognized the need to divide but misapplied it to only one term.",
