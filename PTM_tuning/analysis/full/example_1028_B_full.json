  "explanation": "The correct height calculation uses the difference in y-coordinates between the top left (7) and bottom right (-12):  \n\\( 7 - (-12) = 19 \\).  \n\nThe student likely subtracted x-coordinates instead:  \n\\( 2 - (-4) = 6 \\),  \nmiscalculating horizontal width as vertical height.  \n\nThis shows a confusion between horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) dimensions when determining side lengths. The error directly stems from treating x-values as contributors to vertical distance rather than recognizing height depends solely on y-values.  \n\nThis is distinct from general rectangle property misunderstandings (e.g., side equality) because the student correctly identified coordinates but misapplied axis-specific operations. The error also isn't diagram estimation, as coordinates were explicitly provided.",
