  "explanation": "Correctly, Tom interprets the 1:9 ratio as teachers:students, meaning 9 students per teacher (part-to-part). Katie converts this to part-to-whole: 1 teacher in 10 total people (1 teacher + 9 students). \n\nThe student likely treated both statements as part-to-part comparisons. They might have thought Katie's \"one in ten\" implied a 1:10 ratio of teachers:people (incorrectly assuming 10 parts total instead of 1+9=10), or misapplied the ratio order. \n\nThis stems from failing to distinguish part-to-part (Tom's statement) from part-to-whole (Katie's conversion). The student incorrectly rejected both valid interpretations rather than recognizing the proportional equivalence. \n\nThis aligns with part-to-part/part-to-whole confusion rather than ratio order errors, as both correct answers depend on properly converting between these relationship types.",
