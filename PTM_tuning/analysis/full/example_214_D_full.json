  "explanation": "The correct calculation combines like terms: \n- Coefficients for \\(a\\): \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) \u2192 \\(2a\\)\n- Coefficients for \\(j\\): \\(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\) \u2192 \\(3j\\)\n- Constants: \\(6 + 5 = 11\\)\n\nThe student incorrectly treated repeated addition as exponentiation:\n- \\(a + a = a^2\\) (instead of \\(2a\\))\n- \\(j + j + j = j^3\\) (instead of \\(3j\\))\n\nThe flaw stems from conflating the count of terms with exponents, interpreting \\(a + a\\) as \\(a^2\\) (two instances \u2192 squared) and \\(j + j + j\\) as \\(j^3\\) (three instances \u2192 cubed). This directly misapplies exponent rules to addition, where the coefficients should instead sum linearly. Unlike confusion between addition/multiplication (e.g., \\(a \\cdot a = a^2\\)), this error specifically replaces summation with exponentiation based on term frequency, not arithmetic operation mix-ups.",
