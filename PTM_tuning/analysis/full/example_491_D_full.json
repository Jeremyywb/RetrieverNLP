  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n\\( 7 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 7 \\div 4 \\), since multiplying by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) equals dividing by \\( 4 \\).\n\nStudent's error:  \nThe student concluded the equation was invalid (\"Not possible\") instead of recognizing that \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) implies division by \\( 4 \\).\n\nReasoning flaw:  \nThe student failed to connect multiplication by a fraction with its equivalent division expression. They likely treated multiplication and division as entirely separate operations, not understanding that \\( \\times \\frac{1}{n} \\) is equivalent to \\( \\div n \\). This prevented them from rewriting the multiplication as division.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:  \nUnlike errors involving denominator/numerator confusion, this stems from a failure to recognize the reciprocal relationship between the two operations. The student didn't attempt incorrect fraction manipulation but instead rejected the equivalence entirely.\n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception of not seeing division as a tool to resolve the multiplicative relationship.",
