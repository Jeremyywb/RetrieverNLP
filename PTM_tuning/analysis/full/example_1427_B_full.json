  "explanation": "To solve \\( x + 7 = \\ldots \\), the correct step is subtracting 7:  \n\\( x + 7 - 7 = \\ldots - 7 \\rightarrow x = \\ldots - 7 \\).  \n\nThe student instead applied \\( \\times 7 \\), suggesting they believed multiplying both sides by 7 would isolate \\( x \\). This indicates they misidentified the inverse operation required to undo addition.  \n\nThe error stems from confusing inverse operations: multiplication does not reverse the effect of addition. To eliminate the \\( +7 \\), subtraction is required to maintain equality.  \n\nThis differs from related misconceptions like using division (incorrect inverse for addition) or applying the same operation (e.g., adding 7 again). The student specifically selected an unrelated operation rather than the arithmetic inverse.  \n\nThe flaw lies in treating multiplication as a general \"undoing\" tool for addition, bypassing the need for inverse relationships specific to each operation.",
