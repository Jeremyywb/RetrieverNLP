  "explanation": "The correct net consists of a circular base connected to a sector (lateral surface). The student likely saw two distinct shapes (circle and triangular-looking sector) and interpreted them as separate faces. They combined the sector's straight edges (which actually form the cone's slant height when rolled) with the circle's circumference, mistakenly creating three triangular faces meeting at a vertex. This shows they didn't recognize how a sector transforms into a conical surface when curved, instead treating planar components as literal polyhedron faces. The error stems specifically from misunderstanding how 2D components form curved 3D surfaces, distinct from errors about overlapping shapes or naming individual faces. The key divergence occurred when interpreting the sector's geometric transformation during assembly.",
