  "explanation": "Correct Approach:\nFor Tom's equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n2x - 3y &= 10 \\\\\n5x + 3y &= 18 \\\\\n\\text{Adding: } 7x &= 28 \\Rightarrow x = 4\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor Katie's equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n2x - 3y &= 10 \\\\\n2x + y &= 4 \\\\\n\\text{Subtracting: } -4y &= 6 \\Rightarrow y = -1.5\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBoth pairs can be solved directly by adding/subtracting.\n\nStudent's Error:\nThe student concluded only Katie's equations are valid. They likely attempted to subtract Tom's equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(2x - 3y) - (5x + 3y) &= 10 - 18 \\\\\n-3x - 6y &= -8 \\quad (\\text{no elimination})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis incorrect operation reinforced their belief that Tom's equations need transforming.\n\nFlawed Reasoning:\nThe student assumed elimination requires subtracting equations with matching coefficients of the **same sign**, not recognizing that **opposite signs** allow elimination via addition. They rejected Tom's equations because the \\(y\\)-terms had opposite signs, not realizing adding would cancel them. This reflects a failure to connect coefficient signs with the appropriate operation (addition vs. subtraction).\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nThe error is not about requiring coefficients to be identical for elimination (a related misconception) but specifically misunderstanding how opposite signs enable elimination through addition.",
