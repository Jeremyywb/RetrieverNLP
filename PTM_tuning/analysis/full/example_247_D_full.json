  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \u00a31,456 (initial) + \u00a37,347 (taken) = \u00a38,803; \u00a38,803 - \u00a34,377 (handed out) = \u00a34,426.\n\nStudent's calculation: \u00a37,347 + \u00a34,377 = \u00a311,724; \u00a311,724 - \u00a31,456 = \u00a310,268.\n\nThe student incorrectly treated both \"taken\" and \"handed out\" as positive contributions to the total, summing them first (\u00a37,347 + \u00a34,377) before subtracting the initial amount (\u00a31,456). This reversed the roles of the values: \"handed out\" should reduce the total, not increase it, and the initial amount should be the starting point, not subtracted. The error stems from misassigning operational signs to each value based on their contextual meaning, specifically adding \"handed out\" instead of subtracting it. This aligns with interpreting all numerical values as additive without analyzing their contextual roles, distinct from merely adding all numbers indiscriminately (as the student excluded the initial amount from their first summation).",
