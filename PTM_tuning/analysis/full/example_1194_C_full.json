  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Let (x, y) be the unknown endpoint. Using midpoint formula:\n(-6 + x)/2 = -1 \u2192 x = 2(-1) - (-6) = -2 + 6 = 4\n\nStudent's likely error: Added the known endpoint's x-coordinate (-6) to the midpoint's x-coordinate (-1), treating the midpoint as another endpoint: -6 + (-1) = -7. However, this produces -7, not 6. To arrive at 6, the student may have incorrectly used absolute values: |\u22126| + |\u22121| = 6 + 1 = 7, then subtracted 1 due to the negative midpoint, resulting in 6. This reflects a misapplication of the midpoint formula by summing magnitudes instead of coordinates.\n\nDistinction from related errors: The error stems from treating the midpoint as a component to be added (primary misconception), not from counting spaces/points or directional errors. While the final 6 suggests magnitude manipulation, the core flaw remains the invalid addition of coordinates rather than averaging them.\n\nThe misconception directly caused the error by violating the midpoint formula's requirement to average coordinates, not sum them. Related errors like counting points or ignoring direction don't explain the specific use of arithmetic combination seen here.",
