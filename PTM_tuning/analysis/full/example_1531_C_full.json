  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the scale factor derived from corresponding sides:  \nScale factor = 6/9 = 2/3  \nMissing side = 7.5 \u00d7 (2/3) = 5 cm  \n\nThe student likely calculated:  \nScale factor = (9 - 6)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3  \nMissing side = 7.5 - (7.5 \u00d7 1/3) = 7.5 - 2.5 = 4.5 cm  \n\nThe error stems from interpreting the scale factor additively instead of multiplicatively. The student treated the absolute difference (3 cm) as a proportional reduction (1/3 of the original length) to subtract from 7.5 cm. This conflates absolute differences with relative scaling, violating the multiplicative nature of similarity ratios.  \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of using linear adjustments (like subtraction) instead of proportional scaling. It differs from related errors like misapplying the scale factor (e.g., doubling) because the flaw specifically involves substituting additive reasoning for multiplicative relationships, not merely selecting an incorrect ratio.",
