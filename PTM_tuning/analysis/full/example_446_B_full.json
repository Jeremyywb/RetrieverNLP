  "explanation": "Correct reflection over x=2:  \nSince Q(2,5) lies on the mirror line x=2, its reflection remains (2,5). The horizontal distance from Q to x=2 is 0, so reflection doesn't alter coordinates.\n\nStudent's calculation:  \nThey transformed (2,5) \u2192 (-2,5), implying they computed reflection as (4 - x, y) \u2192 (4-2,5) = (2,5). However, the error suggests they instead used ( -x, y) as the reflection rule.\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student incorrectly treated x=2 as the y-axis (x=0) when applying reflection. This shows they misunderstood how vertical lines positioned away from the origin affect coordinate transformations.\n\nConnection to misconception:  \nBy mislocating the mirror line at x=0 instead of x=2, they applied a reflection formula meant for the y-axis rather than adjusting for the actual line x=2.\n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis isn't confusing vertical/horizontal lines (they recognized x=2 as vertical) nor rotation (the y-coordinate remained unchanged). The core issue was misidentifying the mirror line's position when applying reflection rules.",
