  "explanation": "The correct calculation begins at -1 and adds the temperature increase of 5:  \n\\( -1 + 5 = 4 \\).\n\nThe student's answer, \\( 1 + 4 = 5 \\), suggests they treated the starting temperature (-1) and ending temperature (4) as positive quantities to be summed. \n\nThe error stems from interpreting the arrow\u2019s numerical label (+5) as the result of adding the absolute values of the start and end points, rather than recognizing it as the difference between them. This conflates the operation of addition with the measurement of change. \n\nThe student likely ignored the negative sign on the starting temperature (-1), converted it to 1, then added it to the ending value (4) directly. This aligns with the misconception of combining start and end values instead of computing the directional change. \n\nThis explanation better fits the error than related misconceptions: The student didn\u2019t misread scale increments (each dash is correctly interpreted as 1 unit) or reverse the direction of addition (the arrow indicates upward movement). Instead, they incorrectly treated the problem as summing two positive quantities rather than calculating a signed change.",
