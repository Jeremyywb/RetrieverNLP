  "explanation": "Correct reasoning: A 10-sided polygon uses the Greek prefix \"deca-\" (meaning ten), forming \"decagon.\"\n\nStudent's error: The student incorrectly associated \"hexagon\" (Greek \"hexa-\" for six) with a 10-sided shape.\n\nFlaw explanation: The student conflated the numerical prefixes, mistakenly believing the prefix for six (\"hexa-\") corresponds to ten. This indicates confusion between Latin/Greek numerical roots rather than quantity patterns.\n\nMisconception link: This error stems from misapplying prefix meanings, not from teen/multiple confusion or side count miscalculations. While related misconceptions involve number word misinterpretations, this specifically shows prefix misunderstanding rather than numerical magnitude errors.\n\nDistinction: Unlike teen/single-digit confusion (which deals with place value), this error demonstrates incorrect mapping between prefix and quantity, a separate conceptual misunderstanding.",
