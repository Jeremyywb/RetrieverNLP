  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nPerimeter = 2*(length + width)\n5.6 = 2*(1.02 + star)\n2.8 = 1.02 + star\nstar = 1.78 cm\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n5.6 (total perimeter) - 1.02 (given side) = 4.58 cm\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student treated the rectangle's perimeter as a linear sum of individual sides rather than accounting for pairs of equal sides. They subtracted the single given side length from the total perimeter without doubling it first, then failed to divide the remainder by 2 to account for the remaining pair.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThis shows they neglected the rectangle's property that opposite sides are equal. They treated perimeter as a sequence of unrelated segments rather than a system where two sides of each length must exist.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike general conservation of perimeter misunderstandings, they specifically failed to apply the rectangle's paired-sides property. The error matches \"gives total missing length instead of dividing\" precisely, as 4.58 = 5.6 - 1.02 skips both doubling the known side and halving the remainder.",
