  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3P = 615 \\) \u2192 \\( P = 615 \u00f7 3 = 205 \\).\n\nStudent's likely steps: \\( 615 \u00f7 3 \u2248 600 \u00f7 3 = 200 \\), stopping at the initial estimate without completing the exact division. \n\nThe error stems from truncating the division process after approximating \\( 615 \\) as \\( 600 \\), failing to account for the remaining \\( 15 \\). This reflects a premature rounding of the dividend before performing exact division, treating \\( 615 \\) as a rounded number rather than its precise value. \n\nThis aligns with estimating when exact calculation is required, not ignoring remainders (since \\( 615 \u00f7 3 \\) has no remainder). It differs from subtracting (no subtraction involved) or making uncalculated judgments (some division attempt was made).",
