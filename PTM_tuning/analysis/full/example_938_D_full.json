  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nStarting at -16, adding 3 four times (for the 5th term):\n-16 \u2192 -13 \u2192 -10 \u2192 -7 \u2192 -4.\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nStarting at -16, subtracting 3 four times:\n-16 \u2192 -19 \u2192 -22 \u2192 -25 \u2192 -28 \u2192 -31 (if they subtracted five times).\n\nThe student misapplied the term-to-term rule as subtraction instead of addition. They likely interpreted \"counting up in threes\" as moving to smaller numbers (more negative) by subtracting 3 repeatedly. This aligns with the primary misconception of subtracting instead of adding when the operation requires increasing the value. \n\nThe error is distinct from thinking negative numbers with larger absolute values are greater (which would involve ordering, not sequence generation) or misidentifying the direction on a number line (though subtraction does move left, the core error is the operation choice). The student's repeated subtraction directly caused the incorrect term values.",
