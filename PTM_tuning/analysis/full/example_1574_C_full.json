  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\((\u00a36 + \u00a328) \\times 4 = \u00a334 \\times 4 = \u00a3136\\).  \nStudent's likely calculation: \\(\u00a36 + (\u00a328 \\times 4) = \u00a36 + \u00a3112 = \u00a3118\\).  \n\nThe student treated the \u00a36 magazine as a one-time expense instead of a weekly cost, multiplying only the \u00a328 nails by 4. This reflects a failure to apply the weekly multiplier to both recurring expenses.  \n\nThe error stems from incomplete calculation of all weekly costs, as the student neglected to multiply the magazine cost by 4. This distinguishes it from order-of-operations errors (e.g., adding before multiplying both terms) or subtraction mistakes. The misconception directly aligns with omitting necessary steps in a multi-component problem rather than misapplying arithmetic priorities.",
