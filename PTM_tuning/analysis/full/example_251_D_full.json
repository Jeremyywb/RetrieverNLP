  "explanation": "To eliminate \\( q \\) in Pair 1 (\\( 2p-4q=6 \\) and \\( 7p+4q=9 \\)), adding the equations yields \\( 9p = 15 \\), canceling \\( -4q + 4q \\). The student subtracted them instead, creating \\( -5p -8q = -3 \\), preserving \\( q \\)-terms due to \\(-4q -4q = -8q\\). \n\nFor Pair 2 (\\( 2p-4q=6 \\) and \\( 7p-4q=9 \\)), subtraction correctly eliminates \\( q \\) via \\(-4q - (-4q) = 0\\), but the student applied subtraction universally. \n\nThe flaw occurred in Pair 1: the student assumed terms with **different signs** required subtraction to eliminate, misapplying the elimination rule. This directly matches the misconception that \"different signs mean subtract,\" even though opposite coefficients require addition. The error is isolated to Pair 1, as Pair 2's subtraction was valid (same signs) but was coincidentally correct, masking the underlying misconception.",
