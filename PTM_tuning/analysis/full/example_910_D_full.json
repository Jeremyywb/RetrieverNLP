  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n3(p - 1) = 3\u00b7p - 3\u00b71 = 3p - 3\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n3(p - 1) = 3p - 2\n\nThe student distributed 3 to the first term (p \u2192 3p) but subtracted 2 instead of multiplying the second term by 3. This suggests they treated the \"-1\" as requiring subtraction of (3 - 1) rather than performing 3\u00b7(-1). The error stems from misapplying the distributive property to the second term, where they combined the multiplier (3) with the original constant (-1) through subtraction instead of multiplication. This differs from only multiplying the first term (which would yield 3p -1) or basic multiplication errors (like 3\u00b71=2). The specific substitution of 3-1 for 3\u00b71 shows a flawed understanding of how coefficients interact with negative terms during distribution.",
