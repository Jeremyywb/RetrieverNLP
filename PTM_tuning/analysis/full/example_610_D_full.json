  "explanation": "Correct solution:  \n\\( (w+5)^2 + 25 = 0 \\)  \n\u2192 \\( (w+5)^2 = -25 \\) (no real solutions since squares can't be negative)\n\nStudent's error:  \nSelected \\( (w+5)^2 = 0 \\) as having no solutions.  \nActual solution: \\( w = -5 \\) (one real solution)\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student incorrectly treated \\( (w+5)^2 = 0 \\) as unsolvable rather than recognizing that squaring can produce zero. This stems from misunderstanding that:  \n1. \\( \\sqrt{0} = 0 \\) is valid  \n2. Equations with squared terms equal to zero have exactly one real solution\n\nConnection to misconception:  \nThe error matches \"Believes 0 has no square root\" (a related misconception), not the primary \"Confuses no solution with infinite solutions.\" The student didn't confuse quantity of solutions - they rejected a valid single solution by misapplying square root properties to zero.\n\nDistinction:  \nUnlike the primary misconception (confusing solution quantities), this error specifically involves invalidating a mathematically sound operation (\\( \\sqrt{0} \\)).",
