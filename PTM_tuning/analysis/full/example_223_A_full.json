  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3(5+2) = 21 \\), performing addition first as per the function sequence.  \nStudent's calculation: \\( 5 \\times 3 + 2 = 17 \\), reversing the operation order.  \n\nThe student applied multiplication before addition despite the function machine explicitly requiring \"+2\" first. They treated the operations as independent steps without recognizing the sequence dependency: the input must flow through both operations in the specified order. This reflects a failure to translate the function's procedural steps into a grouped expression where addition precedes multiplication.  \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting how sequential operations translate to mathematical notation, not from bracket omission alone. While related misconceptions mention bracket issues, here the core flaw is reversing operation sequence rather than merely neglecting grouping symbols. The student prioritized standard operator precedence (multiplication before addition) over the explicit instruction order in the problem.",
