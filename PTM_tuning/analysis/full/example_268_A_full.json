  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Starting at (4,4), moving left 2 subtracts 2 from x (4\u21922), moving down 3 subtracts 3 from y (4\u21921). Final position (2,1) is point B.\n\nStudent's error: Likely computed (4+2, 4-3) = (6,1) (point A). This indicates they added 2 to x instead of subtracting, treating \"left\" as a positive x-direction movement.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student reversed the directionality of horizontal translation. In coordinate systems, leftward movement decreases x-values, but they incorrectly associated \"left\" with increasing x, possibly due to misinterpreting translation vectors as absolute additions rather than directional adjustments.\n\nConnection to misconception: This directly stems from misunderstanding how direction affects coordinate changes. The error isn't about swapping axes (which would alter both coordinates incorrectly) but specifically misapplying horizontal direction.\n\nDistinction: Related misconceptions like swapping axes or ignoring vertical movement don't apply here, as the y-coordinate was correctly reduced by 3. The error is isolated to horizontal direction reversal.",
