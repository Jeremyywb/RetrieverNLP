  "explanation": "The correct reflection would create a mirror image where each point's distance from the red line matches the original, but orientation is inverted vertically. For example, a peak in the upper figure would become a valley below the line. \n\nThe student's answer likely preserved the original orientation (e.g., kept peaks as peaks below the line). This occurred because they treated the reflection as a direct copy rather than a vertical inversion. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying reflection as a translation downward instead of a flip, failing to invert the figure across the horizontal axis. This aligns with the misconception that reflection doesn\u2019t require flipping the shape\u2019s orientation. \n\nThis differs from reflecting across the wrong axis (e.g., vertical axis confusion) or general visualization struggles, as the error specifically involves preserving orientation rather than misplacing the reflection entirely.",
