  "explanation": "The correct final step in angle construction involves connecting the marked point to the original vertex to form the angle's second arm. The student incorrectly identified marker placement as the conclusion, omitting the crucial connection step. Their reasoning likely stopped at establishing the angle measurement location rather than completing the angle's geometric formation. This corresponds to a misunderstanding of angle construction as requiring only measurement indication rather than line creation. The error differs from protractor scale issues as it involves step sequence rather than measurement accuracy. Related misconceptions about tool usage don't address this specific failure to recognize required line completion.",
