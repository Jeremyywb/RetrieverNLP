  "explanation": "The correct reflection maps each point \\((a,b)\\) in \\( P \\) to \\((b,a)\\) in \\( Q \\), as seen in the coordinate transformations: \\((2,5) \\to (5,2)\\), \\((2,8) \\to (8,2)\\), \\((4,5) \\to (5,4)\\). This confirms reflection over \\( y=x \\). The student likely observed the coordinate changes but failed to recognize that swapping \\( x \\)- and \\( y \\)-coordinates defines reflection across \\( y=x \\). Their error stems from assuming reflection requires horizontal/vertical symmetry lines, dismissing diagonal transformations. They may have interpreted the coordinate shifts as rotation or translation instead. This differs from related misconceptions about grid alignment, as \\( y=x \\) is a valid grid line but diagonally oriented.",
