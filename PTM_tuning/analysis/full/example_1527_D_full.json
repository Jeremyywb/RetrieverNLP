  "explanation": "The correct angle notation places the vertex (G) between two points on each side (E and H), forming \\( \\mathrm{EGH} \\). The student's answer \\( \\mathrm{CGE} \\) uses the same vertex (G) but incorrectly selects points C and E. This indicates they identified sides CG and GE instead of EG and GH. The error stems from mislabeling the sides of the angle by choosing a point (C) not on the actual side (GH), despite correctly locating the vertex. This aligns with a misunderstanding of how to assign the first and third letters to represent the angle's sides. It differs from selecting a wider angle or using two letters, as the student applied the three-letter convention but with incorrect side identification.",
