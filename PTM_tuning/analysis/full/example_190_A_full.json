  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n1. PQ vector: (4,1), QR vector: (8,2) which is 2\u00d7PQ\n2. PR = PQ + QR = PQ + 2PQ = 3PQ\n3. Ratio PQ:PR = 1:3\n\nStudent's Likely Steps:\n1. Observed PQ components: 4 right, 1 up\n2. Calculated PR components: 4+8=12 right, 1+2=3 up\n3. Multiplied PR's components: 12\u00d73=36\n4. Compared PQ's magnitude (4\u00d71=4) to PR's (36): 4:36 = 1:9 (still inconsistent with 1:12)\nAlternatively:\n1. Added horizontal movements: PQ=4, PR=12\n2. Treated these as independent quantities without scaling, resulting in 4:12=1:3 (correct) but student reported 1:12, suggesting inversion or miscalculation.\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nThe student likely treated the horizontal and vertical components as separate additive quantities but failed to recognize that PR is a direct scalar multiple (3\u00d7) of PQ. Instead of using vector proportionality, they might have incorrectly aggregated components multiplicatively (e.g., 4\u00d73=12) or inverted the ratio, misapplying operations to isolated dimensions rather than the full proportional relationship.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\n- Not a part-to-part vs. part-towhole error (ratio explicitly PQ:PR).\n- Error stems from mishandling component relationships, not forgetting scaling.",
