  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n60,302 = 6\u00d710,000 + 0\u00d71,000 + 3\u00d7100 + 0\u00d710 + 2\u00d71 \u2192 \"Sixty thousand three hundred and two\"\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\nRead as 6\u00d7100 + 3\u00d710 + 2\u00d71 = 632 \u2192 \"Six hundred and thirty-two\"\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nThe student treated the first digit (6) as hundreds instead of ten thousands, skipped the thousands place entirely, and misassigned the remaining digits to lower place values. This compressed the number into three digits instead of interpreting its full positional structure.\n\nMisconception Link:\nThe error stems from misaligning digits to incorrect place value columns. The student failed to recognize that the first digit represents ten thousands, not hundreds, and ignored intermediate zeros that hold positional significance.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nWhile zeros were ignored, the core issue isn't zero omission but incorrect placement of digits across columns. The error isn't a comma misread (no commas here) but a fundamental misapplication of place value hierarchy.",
