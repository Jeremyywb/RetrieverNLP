  "explanation": "The correct calculation identifies x=103\u00b0 through vertically opposite angles or another valid method based on the diagram's parallel lines. The student incorrectly states x=103\u00b0 as alternate angles. Their error stems from misapplying alternate angles where the angles either aren't between parallel lines or aren't positioned correctly (e.g., on the same side of the transversal). This directly aligns with the misconception that alternate angles are always equal without verifying the required parallel line conditions. It differs from confusing co-interior angles (which sum to 180\u00b0) or vertically opposite angles (which are equal but unrelated to parallelism), as the student specifically invoked alternate angles.",
