  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes that in any rhombus, the diagonals \\( AC \\) and \\( DB \\) are always perpendicular. This follows from the defining property that a rhombus's diagonals intersect at 90\u00b0, regardless of its orientation or side lengths.\n\nThe student's conclusion that \"None of them\" are perpendicular suggests they either:\n1. Mistook the rhombus for a general parallelogram (where diagonals aren\u2019t perpendicular), or  \n2. Assumed perpendicular diagonals only occur in squares (a special case of rhombus with right angles).\n\nThe error stems from failing to isolate the unique diagonal relationship in rhombuses. While squares have perpendicular diagonals, this property extends to all rhombuses. The student likely restricted this attribute to squares alone, ignoring the broader class of rhombuses. This aligns with the listed misconception about square-specific properties but not the related kite properties or confusion about intersecting lines.\n\nThe distinction lies in recognizing the student narrowed the scope of perpendicular diagonals to squares rather than understanding it as a universal rhombus trait. Other listed misconceptions (e.g., misidentifying intersecting lines or misunderstanding angle measures) don\u2019t explain the \"none\" response as directly.",
