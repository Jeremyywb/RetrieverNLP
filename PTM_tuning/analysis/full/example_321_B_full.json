  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(5p \\times (-3) = (5 \\times -3) \\times p = -15p\\)\n\nStudent's likely steps: \\(5p \\times 3 = 15p\\)\n\nThe error occurs at the sign handling during multiplication. The student correctly multiplied the coefficients (5\u00d73=15) but failed to apply the negative sign from the second term. This shows they recognized the numerical values but disregarded the sign attached to the constant term.\n\nThe misconception manifests as treating the \"-3\" as a positive value when performing multiplication. This specifically relates to sign neglect during term multiplication, not to confusion about sign interaction rules (like thinking two negatives multiply to negative, which isn't claimed here).\n\nDistinguishing from related errors: The mistake isn't about misapplying sign rules (e.g., \"positive \u00d7 positive = negative\"), but rather omitting the existing negative sign entirely during calculation.",
