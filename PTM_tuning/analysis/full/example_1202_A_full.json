  "explanation": "To solve \\( 3 - y = 5 \\):\n1. Subtract 3: \\( -y = 5 - 3 \\) \u2192 \\( -y = 2 \\)\n2. Multiply by \\(-1\\): \\( y = -2 \\).\n\nThe student likely performed:\n1. Subtract 3: \\( -y = 2 \\)\n2. Wrote \\( y = 2 \\), treating \\(-y\\) as \\( y \\).\n\nThe error occurred when solving \\(-y = 2\\). The student incorrectly interpreted \\(-y\\) as equivalent to \\( y \\), disregarding the negative coefficient. This reflects a failure to apply the inverse operation (multiplying by \\(-1\\)) to isolate \\( y \\), instead assuming the negative sign was irrelevant. While related to \"ignores the negative sign,\" the flaw specifically stems from mishandling the inverse operation required to resolve \\(-y\\), not merely overlooking the sign itself. The misapplication of inverse operations (not addressing the \\(-1\\) multiplier) distinguishes this from simpler sign-ignoring errors.",
