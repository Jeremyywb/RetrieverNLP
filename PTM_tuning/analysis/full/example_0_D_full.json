  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 3\u00d7(2+4)-5 = 3\u00d76-5 = 18-5 = 13  \nIncorrect calculation without brackets: 3\u00d72+4-5 = 6+4-5 = 5\n\nThe student incorrectly assumed operations yield 13 when executed left-to-right without prioritizing multiplication. Their reasoning failed to recognize that multiplication precedes addition/subtraction in standard order of operations, requiring parentheses to alter this hierarchy. By not applying brackets, they preserved the default calculation path (3\u00d72 first) instead of forcing (2+4) to occur first. This directly stems from treating operations as having equal priority to be solved sequentially, rather than following operator precedence rules. This differs from related misconceptions about forced right-to-left calculation or selective bracket application - the error specifically shows disregard for inherent operation priorities rather than alternative directional biases.",
