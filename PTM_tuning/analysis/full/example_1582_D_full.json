  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{9 \\times 5} = \\frac{1}{45}\\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{14}\\), implying \\(9 + 5 = 14\\) in the denominator.  \n\nThe student multiplied numerators correctly (\\(1 \\times 1\\)) but added denominators (\\(9 + 5\\)) instead of multiplying them. This reflects a flawed understanding of fraction multiplication rules, specifically misapplying addition to denominators while handling numerators properly.  \n\nThe error is distinct from adding both numerators and denominators (which would yield \\(\\frac{2}{14}\\)) or replacing multiplication with addition entirely (e.g., \\(\\frac{1+1}{9+5}\\)). The isolated addition of denominators directly explains the result \\(\\frac{1}{14}\\).",
