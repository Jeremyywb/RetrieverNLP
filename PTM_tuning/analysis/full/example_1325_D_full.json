  "explanation": "The correct method recognizes place values: 1 (hundreds) + 0 (tens) + 7 (ones) = \"one hundred seven.\" \n\nThe student likely combined the first and last digits (1 and 7) directly, treating them as adjacent digits in a two-digit number (1 followed by 7 = 17). This error stems from misassigning the digits' positions: they ignored the 0 in the tens place and failed to recognize that the leading \"1\" occupies the hundreds column, not the tens. \n\nBy conflating the hundreds and ones digits as a single 1 and 7 in the tens/ones places, the student disregarded the positional hierarchy required for three-digit numbers. This aligns with a misunderstanding of how place value defines a digit's contribution to the total (e.g., \"1\" represents 100, not 10). \n\nThe error is distinct from right-to-left reading (which would yield 701) or general digit jumbling, as the student specifically collapsed the three-digit number into a two-digit one by skipping the tens place.",
