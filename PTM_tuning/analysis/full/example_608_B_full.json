  "explanation": "The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation \\( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\), with arbitrary starting terms. Tom's sequence \\( 1,1,2,3,5,8,\\ldots \\) and Katie's \\( 1,2,3,5,8,13,\\ldots \\) both satisfy this rule: each term after the second is the sum of the two prior terms. \n\nThe student likely validated Katie's sequence by confirming \\( 1+2=3 \\), \\( 2+3=5 \\), etc., but rejected Tom's sequence due to the repeated initial \"1,1\". This implies they assumed Fibonacci sequences must start with distinct increasing terms (like \\( 1,2 \\)), not recognizing that repeated starting values (e.g., \\( 1,1 \\)) are valid as long as the recurrence relation holds. \n\nThe error stems from conflating specific starting terms with the general definition of a Fibonacci sequence. The student applied the recurrence rule correctly to Katie's sequence but misapplied it to Tom's by requiring distinct initial terms, a flaw distinct from misconceptions about term numbering or n=0 indexing. The core issue is restricting valid sequences to a specific starting pair rather than recognizing the rule's generality.",
