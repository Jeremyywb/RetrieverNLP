  "explanation": "To calculate the gradient at \\( t=8 \\), we find the slope of the tangent line passing through \\( (8,51) \\) and \\( (0,40) \\):  \n\\[\n\\text{Gradient} = \\frac{51 - 40}{8 - 0} = \\frac{11}{8} = 1.375 \\, .\n\\]\nThe student incorrectly reported \\( 51 \\), which is the velocity (\\( y \\)-value) at \\( t=8 \\). This indicates they conflated the function's output (velocity) with the gradient (acceleration), treating them as identical. The error directly stems from not recognizing that the gradient represents the rate of change (acceleration) of velocity, not the velocity itself. This aligns with confusing velocity with acceleration, not merely misinterpreting the y-intercept or failing to compute the slope. The student\u2019s answer reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how gradients quantify derivatives in graphical contexts.",
