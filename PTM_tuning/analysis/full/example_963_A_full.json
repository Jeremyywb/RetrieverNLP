  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n72 \u00d7 36\n  432  (72\u00d76)\n+2160  (72\u00d730)\n=2592\n\nStudent's incorrect steps:\n72 \u00d7 36\n  422  (incorrect 72\u00d76)\n+  27  (incorrect 72\u00d730)\n= 449\n\nThe student miscalculated both partial products. For 72\u00d76: When multiplying 6\u00d72=12, they wrote \"2\" in ones place but failed to carry the 1 to the tens column. Then 6\u00d77=42 was written directly as \"42\" (instead of 42+1=43), producing 422 instead of 432. For 72\u00d730: They treated the tens digit as ones, calculating 3\u00d77=21 and 3\u00d72=6, then concatenated them as \"27\" instead of shifting left and adding a zero. This indicates they didn't recognize the positional value of digits in multiplication.\n\nThe error stems from mishandling place value in two ways: 1) Not adding carried values to subsequent columns, and 2) Failing to shift partial products when multiplying by tens digits. This differs from related errors like left-starting multiplication or addition carry failures, as the core issue is positional treatment of digits during multiplication steps.",
