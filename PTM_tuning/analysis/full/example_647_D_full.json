  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(9 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 9\\sqrt{3}\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is irrational and 3 has no square factors, the expression is already simplified.\n\nThe student incorrectly concluded \"Cannot be simplified,\" failing to recognize that \\(9\\sqrt{3}\\) is the standard simplified form. Their reasoning likely stopped at \"no perfect squares under the radical\" without understanding that multiplying an integer by an irreducible surd constitutes a valid simplified form. \n\nThe primary flaw was misinterpreting \"simplify\" as requiring a numerical transformation of the radical itself, rather than expressing the product in surd form. This caused them to reject \\(9\\sqrt{3}\\) as a valid answer despite it being fully simplified. \n\nThis differs from related misconceptions about multiplying coefficients into radicals or expecting simplification to a whole number, as the error stems from misunderstanding what qualifies as a simplified surd expression, not incorrect arithmetic operations.",
