  "explanation": "Correct solution steps:\n1. Subtract 1 from all three parts: -5-1 < 2x < 5-1 \u2192 -6 < 2x < 4\n2. Divide all parts by 2: -3 < x < 2\n\nStudent's likely steps:\n1. Incorrectly subtracted 1 only from middle/right terms: -5 < 2x < 4\n   (Left term remained -5 instead of becoming -6)\n2. Divided by 2: -5/2 < x < 2 \u2192 -2.5 < x < 2\n   But wrote -2 < x < 2 instead\n\nCritical error: The student failed to consistently subtract 1 from all three inequality segments. They subtracted 1 from the middle and right terms but neglected to subtract it from the left term (-5). This shows they didn't recognize that inverse operations must be applied to every component in a compound inequality.\n\nDistinction: This isn't about sign changes with negative numbers (which weren't divided/multiplied here) or forgetting to subtract from \"both sides\" (which applies to simple inequalities). The specific flaw was partial application of operations across all inequality segments.",
