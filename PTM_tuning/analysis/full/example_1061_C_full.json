  "explanation": "The correct approach recognizes the sequence as quadratic. Second differences are constant (2), so the coefficient of \\( n^2 \\) is \\( 1 \\). Subtracting \\( n^2 \\) from each term yields the linear sequence \\( 9, 17, 25, 33, 41 \\), which has a common difference of \\( 8 \\), leading to \\( 8n + 1 \\). Thus, the nth term is \\( n^2 + 8n + 1 \\), making \\( \\triangle = +8 \\).\n\nThe student likely substituted \\( n=1 \\) into \\( n^2 + \\triangle n + \\square \\), equating \\( 1 + \\triangle + \\square = 10 \\). If they assumed \\( \\triangle = +1 \\) (matching the first term's residual \\( 9 \\)), they would calculate \\( \\square = 8 \\). However, this ignores subsequent terms: for \\( n=2 \\), \\( 4 + 2(1) + 8 = 14 \\neq 21 \\). The error stems from isolating the first term to determine \\( \\triangle \\), disregarding the need to derive the linear component systematically. This aligns with \"believes they can find the nth term based on the first term only,\" not merely misusing term-to-term differences or first differences. Related misconceptions about first differences or term-to-term rules don't explain the +1 error here, as the student's focus was on initial-term fitting rather than difference patterns.",
