  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( h = 7 \\) cm (explicitly labeled as the perpendicular height in the diagram).  \nStudent's error: Substituted \\( h = 3 \\) cm (the shorter parallel side).  \n\nThe student incorrectly used the length of the shorter parallel side (3 cm) as the height instead of the labeled perpendicular height (7 cm). This occurred because they conflated the role of the bases in the formula with the height parameter, likely assuming the numerical value of one base directly corresponded to \\( h \\).  \n\nThe error stems from misidentifying which quantity represents the height in the formula. The student treated the trapezium's base length as interchangeable with its vertical height, ignoring the diagram's explicit labeling of the 7 cm perpendicular height.  \n\nThis is distinct from confusing the formula's structure (e.g., omitting the average of bases) or misusing non-perpendicular side lengths, as the error specifically replaces the height parameter with a base value.",
