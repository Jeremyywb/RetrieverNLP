  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n\\( (27)^{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\left(27^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\right)^4 = 3^4 = 81 \\)\n\nStudent's likely error:  \n\\( 27 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 20.25 \\)\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student incorrectly treated the exponent \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) as a multiplicative factor rather than an operation requiring sequential roots and powers. They converted the exponent into its reciprocal fraction \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and multiplied it directly by the base. This misapplication of exponent rules conflates fractional exponents with linear scaling.\n\nConnection to misconception:  \nThe error stems from interpreting the fractional exponent as requiring multiplication by the reciprocal of the exponent's fraction, not from merely multiplying by the numerator or misordering operations. This distinguishes it from related errors like multiplying base and power or misapplying roots/powers in sequence.\n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nIf the student had multiplied \\(27 \\times 4\\) (numerator focus) or \\(27 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\), results like \\(108\\) or \\(36\\) would occur. The specific result \\(20.25\\) confirms they used the reciprocal of the exponent fraction.",
