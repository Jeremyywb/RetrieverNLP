  "explanation": "The x-axis consists of all points where \\( y=0 \\), making \\( y=0 \\) the correct equation. The student's equation \\( x=y \\) suggests they interpreted the x-axis as containing points where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) coordinates are equal. This reasoning misidentifies the defining characteristic of the x-axis (fixed \\( y=0 \\)) with an unrelated condition (\\( x=y \\)). The error stems from conflating equality of coordinates (a diagonal line) with the axis' actual definition. This explanation aligns with the stated misconception about equal coordinates on axes, rather than confusion about horizontal/vertical line equations or misassigning \\( x=0 \\) to the x-axis. The student's answer reflects a direct substitution of \"x-axis\" with \\( x=y \\), bypassing the necessary understanding of axis-specific coordinate constraints.",
