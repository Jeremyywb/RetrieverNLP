  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires identifying the maximum (22 cm) and minimum (4 cm) values, then subtracting: 22 cm - 4 cm = 18 cm.\n\nThe student likely subtracted the last number (7 cm) from the first number (4 cm), arriving at 7 cm - 4 cm = 3 cm.\n\nThis error stems from assuming the data list was already ordered numerically, causing them to incorrectly treat the first and last entries as the extremes. The student failed to recognize that the true maximum (22 cm) appeared second in the unordered dataset.\n\nThis directly matches the misconception of assuming a list is given in size order, as opposed to other errors like calculating mean/median. The student's operation (subtracting two values) confirms they attempted a range calculation, but their misidentification of extremes aligns with trusting the original order instead of sorting.\n\nRelated misconceptions like \"not ordering data first\" are broader, but this specific error shows the student believed the existing order reflected sorted values, making it distinct from other calculation-type errors.",
