  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The pie chart has 8 equal sections. Red occupies 2 sections, so fraction = 2/8 = 1/4. Total people = 24 \u2192 24 \u00d7 1/4 = 6.\n\nStudent's likely steps: \n1. Correctly divided total people by total sections: 24 \u00f7 8 = 3 per section\n2. Stopped here, answering 3 instead of multiplying by red sections (2)\n\nSpecific flaw: The student isolated the value per section (3 people/section) but failed to multiply this by the number of red sections (2). This matches the misconception of calculating one ratio part but not scaling it to the required quantity.\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"forgetting a scale factor\" because the student *did* compute the base rate (3/section). The error lies specifically in not applying that rate to the 2 red sections.\n\nThe error stems from treating the per-section quantity as a final answer rather than an intermediate step, directly linking to the misconception about incomplete ratio application.",
