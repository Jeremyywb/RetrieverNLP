  "explanation": "The correct equation for a horizontal line through \\( y=3 \\) is \\( y=3 \\), where the slope is implicitly \\( 0 \\). The student wrote \\( y=3x \\), treating \\( 3 \\) as the slope instead of the y-intercept. This shows they forced the equation into the \\( y=mx+b \\) template, assuming a non-zero slope is required. Their misconception conflated the role of the constant term, interpreting it as a multiplier of \\( x \\) rather than a standalone y-intercept. This differs from confusing the y-intercept with the gradient in \\( y=a \\), as the error specifically stems from mandating a slope term's presence. The related misconception about direct proportion graphs (which require \\( y=kx \\)) is less applicable here, since the student didn't confuse horizontal lines with proportional relationships but rather misapplied the linear equation structure.",
