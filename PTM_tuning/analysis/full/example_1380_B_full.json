  "explanation": "The correct perpendicular slope to IJ's gradient of -3 is 1/3 (since \\(-3 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = -1\\)). KL has this slope. \n\nThe student selected EF, a vertical line (undefined slope). Their reasoning likely conflated vertical lines as universally perpendicular, ignoring the requirement that perpendicular slopes must multiply to -1. \n\nThis error stems from treating vertical orientation as inherently creating right angles with any line, rather than applying the slope criterion. It specifically reflects a visual assumption about vertical/horizontal relationships overriding algebraic verification. \n\nThis differs from \"believes any crossing lines are perpendicular,\" as EF and IJ might not visibly intersect at 90\u00b0, but the student fixated on EF's verticality alone. It also contrasts with \"does not know parallel gradients,\" as the error wasn't about equivalence but misapplied geometric intuition.",
