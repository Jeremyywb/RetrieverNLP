  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(100^3 = 100 \\times 100 \\times 100 = 10,\\!000 \\times 100 = 1,\\!000,\\!000\\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\(100^3 = 100 \\times 1000 = 100,\\!000\\).\n\nThe student treated cubing as multiplying by \\(10^3\\) (1000) instead of performing three multiplicative iterations of 100. This reflects a confusion between exponentiation (\\(100^3\\)) and multiplying by a power of ten with the exponent's value (\\(100 \\times 10^3\\)). The error aligns with misapplying the exponent as a direct multiplier of 10 rather than an iterative operation. \n\nThis differs from \"multiplying by 3,\" which would yield 300, and from miscounting zeros during multiplication steps, which would involve partial intermediate errors. The student\u2019s single-step miscalculation specifically substitutes the exponent\u2019s value for a power-of-ten multiplier, directly linking to the misconception of conflating exponentiation with scaling by \\(10^n\\).",
