  "explanation": "Correct analysis: In rectangle ABCD, sides BC and CD are adjacent sides meeting at right angle C. Diagonal BD creates triangle BCD with angle C = 90\u00b0, making it right-angled by definition.\n\nStudent's reasoning: Likely measured BC \u2260 CD \u2260 BD (valid in non-square rectangles) to conclude \"scalene,\" but failed to prioritize angle classification over side lengths. This shows misunderstanding of triangle categorization hierarchy where angle properties supersede side length classifications.\n\nThe error stems from treating scalene/equilateral/isosceles categories (side-based) and acute/right/obtuse (angle-based) as mutually exclusive rather than recognizing that right-angled triangles can simultaneously have unequal sides. This directly connects to misapplying rectangle properties - while correctly noting side differences, they neglected the right angle created by the rectangle's corner and diagonal.\n\nThis differs from confusing scalene/equilateral (which would require equal side claims) or not knowing right angle definitions (which would prevent identifying any right-angled triangle). The core flaw is hierarchical misprioritization of classification criteria, not factual unawareness of angles or side relationships.",
