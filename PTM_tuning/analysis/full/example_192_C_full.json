  "explanation": "The correct rounding process for 2426.951 to 1 decimal place:\n1. Identify the first decimal digit (9 in tenths place)\n2. Look at the next digit (5 in hundredths place)\n3. Since 5 \u2265 5, round the tenths place up\n4. 9 + 1 = 10, requiring a carry to the units place: 2426.9 \u2192 2427.0\n\nThe student's incorrect calculation stopped at:\n1. Recognized the 5 required rounding up\n2. Attempted to add 1 to the tenths place\n3. Wrote 9 in tenths place (2426.9) without performing the carry operation\n\nThe flaw occurred when incrementing the 9 in the tenths place. The student treated it as a standalone digit (incorrectly keeping it at 9), rather than propagating the carry through the number. This demonstrates a failure to handle place value interactions during rounding when a 9 requires incrementation. \n\nThe error differs from general \"rounds down with 5\" or truncation misconceptions, as the student did attempt to round up (result is higher than original tenths digit). The specific failure stems from improper handling of the decimal place overflow, not from misapplying rounding thresholds.",
