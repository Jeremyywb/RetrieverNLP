  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3600 \\div 60 \\div 60 = 1 \\) (seconds \u2192 minutes \u2192 hours).\n\nStudent's likely steps: \\( 3600 \\div 60 = 60 \\), treating this as the final answer. \n\nThe error occurred when converting seconds directly to hours using a single division by 60 (seconds-to-minutes ratio) instead of dividing by \\( 60 \\times 60 = 3600 \\). The student conflated the two-step conversion (seconds \u2192 minutes \u2192 hours) into one step, misapplying the seconds-to-minutes factor to the entire conversion. This aligns with confusing hierarchical units (stopping at minutes but labeling them as hours) rather than miscalculating division or misdefining hourly seconds. It differs from assuming 100 seconds/hour, which would yield \\( 36 \\) instead of \\( 60 \\).",
