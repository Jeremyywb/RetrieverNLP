  "explanation": "The correct equation recognizes all points on the horizontal line share the same y-value (3), yielding \\( y=3 \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly wrote \\( x=3 \\), treating the y-intercept as an x-coordinate constant. This shows they conflated the axis where the intercept occurs with the variable held constant in the equation. \n\nThe error stems from misattributing the axis label (y=3 intercept) to the variable constrained in the equation (x instead of y). This directly links to confusing which variable corresponds to horizontal vs. vertical line equations. \n\nIt differs from believing vertical lines use \\( y= \\) (they used \\( x= \\)) or intentionally swapping variables for perpendicularity (no indication of intentional transformation). The mistake purely involves misassigning the constant variable based on intercept location.",
