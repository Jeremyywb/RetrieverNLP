  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Start with \\( g = 2r + 3 \\)\n2. Subtract 3: \\( g - 3 = 2r \\)\n3. Divide by 2: \\( r = \\frac{g - 3}{2} \\)\n\nStudent's incorrect steps:\n1. Attempted to isolate \\( r \\) by writing \\( r = g + 3 \\div 2 \\)\n\nFlawed reasoning:\nThe student treated division as the first step instead of subtraction, failing to reverse the original equation's order of operations (addition after multiplication). This caused them to divide only the constant term (3) by 2 instead of first subtracting 3 from \\( g \\). The error stems from applying operations left-to-right rather than undoing them in reverse sequence. \n\nDistinction from related errors:\nWhile the answer resembles a failure to divide all terms by 2, the core issue is the reversed operation sequence - the student didn't address the \"+3\" before handling the \"\u00d72\". This prioritizes operational order misunderstanding over division distribution errors.",
