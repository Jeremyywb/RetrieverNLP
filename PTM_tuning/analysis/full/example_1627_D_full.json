  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The area under section A (a triangle) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 10\\,\\text{s} \\times 20\\,\\text{m/s} = 100\\,\\text{m}\\).\n\nStudent's error: They likely computed \\(\\sqrt{10^2 + 20^2} \\approx 22.36\\), treating the line segment's length as distance. \n\nFlaw: The student conflated geometric distance (Pythagorean length of the line on the graph) with physical distance (area under the velocity-time curve). \n\nConnection to misconception: They incorrectly interpreted the graph's diagonal line as requiring spatial measurement via Pythagoras, rather than analyzing time and velocity components to calculate area. \n\nDistinction: This differs from \"distance = speed + time\" (arithmetic error) or gradient miscalculations, as the error stems from misapplying geometry to extract physical quantities.",
