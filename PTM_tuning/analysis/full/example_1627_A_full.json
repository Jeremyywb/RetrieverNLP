  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the area of a triangle formula: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 10\\,\\text{s} \\times 20\\,\\text{m/s} = 100\\,\\text{m}\\).  \nThe student likely calculated \\(10\\,\\text{s} \\times 20\\,\\text{m/s} = 200\\,\\text{m}\\), treating the triangle as a rectangle.  \nThey misapplied the formula for area by omitting the division by 2 required for triangles.  \nThis directly stems from conflating the formulas for rectangles (base \u00d7 height) and triangles (\\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times\\) base \u00d7 height).  \nThe error is distinct from trapezoid-related misconceptions, as the graph forms a triangle (not a trapezoid) with a single sloped line.  \nIt also differs from averaging errors, as triangles inherently require division by 2 regardless of averaging logic.",
