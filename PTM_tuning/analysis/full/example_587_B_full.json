  "explanation": "Correct calculation for Problem P: \\(6 \\div 3 = 2\\), then \\(2 + 5 = 7\\).  \nStudent's incorrect step: Calculated \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) first in Problem P.  \n\nThe student treated addition as having equal or higher priority than division in Problem P, despite division requiring precedence. This reflects a failure to apply the hierarchy of operations (division before addition). The error aligns with prioritizing addition over division, distinct from left-to-right execution, as the student correctly applied left-to-right for division and multiplication in Problem Q. The misconception specifically involves misordering operations by precedence, not merely ignoring all priority rules.",
