  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n0.8 \u00d7 0.15 = (8/10) \u00d7 (15/100) = 120/1000 = 0.12\n\nIncorrect process: \nThe student likely calculated 8 \u00d7 15 = 120, then placed the decimal with only one position (producing 1.2) instead of three.\n\nSpecific flaw: \nThe student treated the decimals as whole numbers (8 \u00d7 15) but failed to account for all three decimal places required by the original factors (1 in 0.8 + 2 in 0.15). This caused them to shift the decimal point one place instead of three.\n\nConnection to misconception: \nThe error directly stems from ignoring place value's role in determining decimal positions. The student preserved digit magnitude (120) but misapplied decimal placement rules.\n\nDistinction from related errors: \nWhile 1.2 is larger than both factors, this stems from decimal misplacement rather than a belief that multiplication must increase values. The error also doesn't involve dropping significant zeros (0.12 vs. 1.2 isn't a zero issue).",
