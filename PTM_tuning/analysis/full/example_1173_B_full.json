  "explanation": "The correct answer uses the inequality \\( t > 9 \\), where \">\" denotes \"greater than.\" The student wrote \\( t = 9 \\), replacing the inequality with an equality symbol. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the problem's requirement to express a comparison (t exceeding 9) as a declaration of equivalence (t being exactly 9). This confusion conflates equality (\"is\") with inequality (\"is greater than\"), directly substituting the wrong symbol. \n\nThe misconception reflects a failure to distinguish between equality and inequality operators, not a reversal of comparison direction (e.g., writing \\( t < 9 \\)) or a misunderstanding of the identity symbol (which was not used). The student focused on fixing t to a single value rather than representing a range of possible values greater than 9, indicating a lack of differentiation between equations and inequalities.",
