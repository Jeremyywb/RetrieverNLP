  "explanation": "The correct angle measurement uses the inner scale starting from 0\u00b0 on the right. The second ray aligns at 55\u00b0 on the inner scale (between 50 and 60). The student, however, placed the second ray between 40 and 50 on the inner scale (45\u00b0) and at 135\u00b0 on the outer scale. \n\nThe error occurs because the student read the outer scale (which decreases from 180\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 when measuring anticlockwise from the right) instead of the inner scale (which increases from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0). This caused them to misinterpret the outer scale's 135\u00b0 as the angle measure, rather than using the inner scale's 45\u00b0. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of reading the wrong protractor scale for angles not in the standard orientation. The student failed to recognize that the inner scale corresponds to measurements starting at the right-side 0\u00b0. Distinguishing from related misconceptions, this is not a case of misaligning the protractor or confusing reflex angles, but specifically misapplying the scale directionality.",
