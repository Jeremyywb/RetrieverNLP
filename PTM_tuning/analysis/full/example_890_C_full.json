  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n\\( m(m - 2) = m \\cdot m + m \\cdot (-2) = m^2 - 2m \\)\n\nStudent's error: \nThey computed \\( m \\cdot m = 2m \\) instead of \\( m^2 \\), then combined it with \\( m \\cdot (-2) = -2m \\), resulting in \\( 2m - 2m \\).\n\nSpecific flaw: \nThe student treated the multiplication of \\( m \\) and \\( m \\) as additive (interpreting \\( m \\cdot m \\) as \\( m + m = 2m \\)) rather than applying exponent rules for variables. This directly caused the \\( m^2 \\) term to become \\( 2m \\).\n\nConnection to misconception: \nThis error stems from conflating addition and multiplication of variables. The student applied addition rules (combining coefficients) where multiplication rules (adding exponents) were required.\n\nDistinguishing from related misconceptions: \nThey correctly distributed \\( m \\) to both terms (showing knowledge of distribution), but misapplied variable multiplication. This isn't a case of ignoring variables or only multiplying constants, as \\( m \\cdot (-2) \\) was computed correctly.\n\nFinal explanation: \nThe student incorrectly added the coefficients of \\( m \\) during multiplication (\\( m \\cdot m \\rightarrow 2m \\)) instead of multiplying variables to create \\( m^2 \\), leading to cancellation with the \\( -2m \\) term.",
