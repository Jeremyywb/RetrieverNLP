  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{2}{9} \\)\n\nStudent's likely calculation: \n\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\), then squared the result: \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9} \\)\n\nThe error occurred because the student squared the entire expression \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\) instead of squaring only the \\( x \\)-value first. This shows they treated the coefficient \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) as part of the base being squared, misapplying the exponent to the entire product rather than the variable term alone. \n\nThis matches the primary misconception of incorrectly extending the exponent's scope to include the coefficient. It differs from related errors like \"squaring the denominator's 2\" (which would produce \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)) or confusing squaring with halving (which would skip the exponent entirely). The key flaw was conflating the multiplicative relationship between coefficient and variable with the exponential operation.",
