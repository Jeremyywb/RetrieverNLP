  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 19,103 - 5 = 19,098  \nStudent's likely calculation: 19,103 - 4 = 19,099  \n\nThe student subtracted 4 instead of 5 due to incorrect borrowing through the zero in the tens place. When subtracting 5 from 3 in the ones place, proper borrowing requires converting 19,103 to 19,0(10)3 \u2192 19,09(13) before subtracting 5. The student likely either:  \n1. Failed to account for the full borrow from the hundreds place, treating it as a single-digit borrow instead of cascading through two place values  \n2. Mistakenly subtracted 4 after borrowing, possibly conflating digit manipulation with step size  \n\nThis matches the \"Miscounts when subtracting over zero\" pattern rather than simple step confusion. The error is distinct from adding one or miscounting steps, as it specifically involves multi-place subtraction mechanics around zeros. The 1-digit difference (19,098 vs 19,099) confirms this was a borrowing error, not step-size misunderstanding.",
