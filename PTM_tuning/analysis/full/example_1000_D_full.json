  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1-t}{t-1} = \\frac{-(t-1)}{t-1} = -1 \\quad \\text{(after canceling } t-1\\text{)}\n\\]\n\nStudent's error:\nThe student likely observed \\( \\frac{1-t}{t-1} \\) and concluded the numerator and denominator have no identical terms to cancel. They failed to recognize that \\( 1-t = -(t-1) \\), a critical step for revealing the common factor.\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student treated \\( 1-t \\) and \\( t-1 \\) as unrelated expressions rather than negatives of each other. This prevented them from factoring out \\(-1\\) to expose the common \\( t-1 \\) term required for simplification.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThis stems from an inability to recognize equivalent forms of algebraic expressions through factorization. Unlike cancellation errors or misunderstanding common factors, this error specifically involves missing the relationship between \\( 1-t \\) and \\( t-1 \\) via sign reversal.\n\nDistinction:\nThe error isn't about misapplying cancellation rules (which would involve invalid term-by-term elimination) but rather failing to see that the expressions differ by a factor of \\(-1\\) - a prerequisite for simplification.",
