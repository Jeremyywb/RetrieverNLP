  "explanation": "Correct approach:\nFactors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6  \nFactors of 9: 1, 3, 9  \nCommon factors: 1, 3\n\nStudent's error:\nLikely listed multiples instead:  \nMultiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24...  \nMultiples of 9: 9, 18, 27...  \nSelected first common multiple (18)\n\nKey flaw:\nThe student confused factors (numbers that divide exactly) with multiples (results from multiplying the number). This led them to search for common products rather than shared divisors. While 18 is indeed a common multiple, the problem required identifying shared divisors. This directly stems from misunderstanding the fundamental definition of \"factor\" rather than calculation errors with times tables or number selection habits. The error is distinct from simply choosing the largest available number (18 isn't a factor of either) or multiple identification errors (which would still require understanding the term \"factor\").",
