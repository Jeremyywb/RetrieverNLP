  "explanation": "To calculate the median correctly:\n1. Order the numbers: -4, 3, 5, 6, 18, 18\n2. Average the 3rd and 4th terms: (5 + 6)/2 = 5.5\n\nThe student likely:\n1. Used the original order: 3,5,6,18,18,-4\n2. Incorrectly took the 3rd term (6) as the median without sorting\n\nThe error stems from assuming data ordering is unnecessary. By skipping sorting, they identified the middle position (6) in the raw sequence rather than the ordered sequence. This matches the misconception of ignoring data ordering, not confusion with mean calculation (which would produce \u22487.67) or misapplying n/2 (which would still require sorting). The answer 6 directly corresponds to a term in the original unsorted list, confirming the primary issue was failure to order values first.",
