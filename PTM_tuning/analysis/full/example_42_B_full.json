  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows that parallel lines must have identical gradients, resulting in 5. \n\nThe student incorrectly calculated \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\), which is the negative reciprocal of the original gradient. \n\nThis error directly stems from applying the slope relationship for perpendicular lines (where \\(m_1 \\cdot m_2 = -1\\)) instead of recognizing that parallel lines require equal gradients. \n\nThe student conflated the definitions of parallel and perpendicular lines, using the reciprocal rule reserved for perpendicularity while believing it applied to parallelism. \n\nThis distinguishes from misconceptions like not knowing the term \"perpendicular,\" as the error specifically misapplies the perpendicular slope formula rather than exhibiting general confusion about terminology. \n\nThe key flaw is the substitution of perpendicularity criteria for parallelism, not a lack of gradient equality awareness alone.",
