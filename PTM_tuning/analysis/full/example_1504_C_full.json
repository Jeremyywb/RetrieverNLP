  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows \\(4^3 = 64\\) through repeated multiplication: \\(4 \\times 4 \\times 4\\).  \nThe student likely calculated \\(4 \\times 100 = 400\\), treating the exponent as a digit to append.  \nThe flaw is misinterpreting the exponent notation: they assumed \\(4^n\\) means writing \"4\" followed by \\(n\\) zeros (like \\(10^n\\)), not multiplying \\(4\\) by itself \\(n-1\\) times.  \nThis directly connects to misreading the exponent as a normal digit (e.g., interpreting \\(4^2\\) as \"4 followed by two zeros\" instead of \\(4 \\times 4\\)).  \nIt differs from multiplying base and exponent (\\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\)) or confusing multiplication for exponentiation (\\(4 \\times 3\\) instead of \\(4^3\\)), as the error specifically involves place-value misinterpretation.  \nThe student\u2019s answer matches this reasoning, as \\(400\\) results from appending two zeros to \\(4\\), reflecting a digit-based reading of the exponent.",
