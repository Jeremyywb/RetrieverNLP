  "explanation": "The correct fraction calculation uses the total rectangle parts as denominator:  \nShaded parts (27) \u00f7 Total parts (100) = \\( \\frac{27}{100} \\).\n\nThe student likely performed:  \nShaded parts (27) \u00f7 Unshaded parts (73) = \\( \\frac{27}{73} \\).\n\nThe error stems from treating the unshaded parts (73) as the whole instead of the total parts (100). This directly substitutes a part-to-part ratio (shaded:unshaded) for the required part-to-whole relationship (shaded:total). \n\nThe misconception conflates the distinction between comparing two subsets (27:73) and expressing a subset's proportion relative to the entire set. Related errors like misidentifying the whole (e.g., counting sub-regions incorrectly) don\u2019t apply here, as the student correctly recognized the total parts (100) but misassigned the denominator.",
