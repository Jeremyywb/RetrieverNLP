  "explanation": "The correct reasoning shows:\n- 12y \u00f7 y = 12 (integer), confirming y is a factor\n- 12y \u00f7 3 = 4y (integer for any integer y), confirming 3 is a factor\n\nThe student likely:\n1. Correctly recognized that 12y \u00f7 y = 12 (agreeing with Tom)\n2. Incorrectly calculated 12y \u00f7 3 = (12 \u00f7 3) + (y \u00f7 3) = 4 + y/3\n3. Concluded 3 isn't a factor because y/3 might not be integer\n\nThe flaw stems from mishandling division distribution: treating 12y \u00f7 3 as (12 \u00f7 3) + (y \u00f7 3) instead of (12 \u00f7 3) * y. This demonstrates misunderstanding algebraic term division structure. \n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception (dividing algebraic terms) rather than number factorization issues, as the error specifically occurs in splitting variables/numerics during division rather than failing to recognize 3 divides 12.",
