  "explanation": "To compare \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\), and \\(\\frac{13}{40}\\), a common denominator of 40 is used. Correct conversions: \\(\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{16}{40}\\), \\(\\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{15}{40}\\), and \\(\\frac{13}{40}\\) remains. Chocolate (\\(16/40\\)) is largest.\n\nThe student likely compared numerators directly without conversion: \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(13\\). They treated numerators as absolute values across different denominators, concluding \\(13 > 3 > 2\\). This ignores that fractions require equivalent denominators for valid comparison.\n\nThe error stems from failing to adjust numerators when establishing equivalence. The student preserved original numerators while changing denominators to 40 (e.g., leaving \\(2/5\\) as \\(2/40\\) instead of scaling by 8). This directly caused misranking of fractions.\n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception (forgetting to adjust numerators) rather than LCM usage errors or digit-length bias. The student's method omitted the critical step of proportionally scaling numerators when converting fractions, making the denominator change mathematically invalid.",
