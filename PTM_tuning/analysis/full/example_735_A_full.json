  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nShaded width = Total width - First step width = 23m - 7m = 16m  \nShaded height = Total height - Third step height = 22m - 8m = 14m  \nArea = 16m \u00d7 14m = 224m\u00b2\n\nStudent's likely error:\nIncorrectly calculated: 7m \u00d7 5m = 35m\u00b2 (first step) and 6m \u00d7 8m = 48m\u00b2 (third step), then added them: 35 + 48 + (middle step) = 120m\u00b2 (approximated).\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student treated the shaded section as three separate rectangles to be summed (first, middle, and third steps) rather than a single continuous rectangle. This indicates they fragmented the shape into its visible \"steps\" and summed their areas, misinterpreting the shaded region's continuity.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThe error stems from viewing the shaded area as additive components of the composite shape rather than identifying it as one unified rectangle requiring dimension derivation. This aligns with the misconception of calculating parts without recognizing overlaps or unified structures.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike perimeter confusion or full-rectangle miscalculations, this error specifically involves incorrect additive partitioning of the shaded region into non-overlapping sub-rectangles rather than a failure to subtract or use total dimensions.",
