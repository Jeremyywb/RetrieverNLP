  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n1. Multiply both sides by 3: \\(5d - 2 = 3(2d - 1)\\)\n2. Expand: \\(5d - 2 = 6d - 3\\)\n3. Subtract \\(5d\\): \\(-2 = d - 3\\)\n4. Add 3: \\(1 = d\\)\n\nStudent's Likely Steps:\n1. After reaching \\(-d = -1\\), the student likely concluded \\(d = -1\\) by directly equating the negative variable to the constant's sign.\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nThe student treated \\(-d = -1\\) as equivalent to \\(d = -1\\) instead of multiplying both sides by \\(-1\\). This reflects a direct misinterpretation of negative coefficients in final solutions.\n\nConnection to Misconception:\nThe error stems from mishandling negative signs in the final isolation step, not from earlier fraction operations or inverse operation errors. Related misconceptions like improper fraction clearing would produce different intermediate results (e.g., \\(d = \\frac{1}{3}\\)), which don't align with the student's \\(-1\\) answer.\n\nDistinction:\nThis error specifically occurs at the final step of solving, not during earlier equation transformations like fraction elimination or term redistribution.",
