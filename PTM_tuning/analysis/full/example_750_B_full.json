  "explanation": "The correct approach factors numerator and denominator to check for common factors:\nNumerator: \\(3m +15 = 3(m +5)\\)\nDenominator: \\(m^2 -2m +15\\) (irreducible, discriminant = \\((-2)^2 -4(1)(15) = -56\\))\n\nThe student incorrectly transformed:\n\\[\n\\frac{3m+15}{m^2-2m+15} \\rightarrow \\frac{3m}{m^2-2m}\n\\]\nby removing \"+15\" from both numerator and denominator. This assumes separate term cancellation rather than factoring. The error stems from treating addition as multiplication - they divided numerator and denominator by different values (specifically, subtracted 15 from both polynomials) instead of requiring identical factors. This directly matches the misconception of dividing by different values, not merely number-focused simplification errors. The key distinction is the invalid term-wise cancellation rather than incorrect coefficient handling.",
