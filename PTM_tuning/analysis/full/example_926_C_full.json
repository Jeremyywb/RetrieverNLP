  "explanation": "The correct answer requires identifying numbers that divide 24 evenly (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24), which are its factors. The student incorrectly chose \"multiples,\" which are values like 24, 48, 72..., created by multiplying 24 by integers. \n\nThe error stems from conflating division with multiplication. The problem asks for divisors of 24 (factors), but the student focused on results of multiplying 24 (multiples). This directly reflects a failure to distinguish between the two inverse operations: factors involve division (24 \u00f7 friends = whole number), while multiples involve repeated addition (24 \u00d7 1, 24 \u00d7 2...). \n\nThe mistake aligns with confusing the definitions of \"factor\" and \"multiple,\" not with misapplying LCM/HCF or assuming divisibility by multiples of factors. The answer \"multiples\" is mathematically invalid here, as multiples of 24 exceed the original quantity (e.g., 48 friends can't receive 24 cakes equally), whereas factors ensure exact division.",
