  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Starting at -11, adding 7 moves right 7 units: -11 \u2192 -10 (1) \u2192 -9 (2) \u2192 -8 (3) \u2192 -7 (4) \u2192 -6 (5) \u2192 -5 (6) \u2192 -4 (7).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely began at -11 and counted 7 positions including the starting point: -11 (counted as 1), -10 (2), -9 (3), -8 (4), -7 (5), -6 (6), -5 (7). This caused them to stop at -5 instead of -4.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated the initial position as the first counted step, effectively reducing the total movement by 1 unit. This aligns with misinterpreting number line gaps by conflating position counts with distance traveled.\n\nDistinction from related errors: This isn't about direction (they moved right) or step size (they used unit steps), but rather a miscount rooted in how positions are enumerated versus distances measured. The error stems from conflating ordinal counting (positions) with cardinal addition (quantity).",
