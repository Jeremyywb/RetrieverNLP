  "explanation": "The correct factorization requires two numbers that add to 5 (the coefficient of p) and multiply to 4 (the constant term). These numbers are 1 and 4, yielding (p+1)(p+4).\n\nThe student chose 1 and 5, producing (p+1)(p+5). This pair adds to 6 and multiplies to 5, failing both required conditions. The critical flaw is that the student selected numbers multiplying to 5 (the coefficient of p) instead of 4 (the constant term). This directly misapplies the factoring rule, prioritizing the middle term's coefficient for multiplication rather than the constant term. \n\nWhile their answer also fails the sum check (6\u22605), the root error stems from misassigning which term governs the product requirement. This distinguishes it from related errors like choosing numbers that multiply to the constant but sum incorrectly, as the student here incorrectly tied the product to the linear term instead of the constant.",
