  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires determining the proportion of comedy preferences relative to the total (9/(9+4+7)) and then applying this fraction to 360\u00b0. \n\nThe student computed 360 \u00f7 9 = 40, treating the frequency of comedy (9) as the sole divisor for the full circle. This skips the critical step of calculating the total number of data points (9+4+7=20) and using it to establish the proportion. \n\nThe error stems from directly equating the category's frequency to the divisor for 360\u00b0, implying that each individual data point (e.g., each teacher) corresponds to an equal sector of the circle. This bypasses the need to compute the relative frequency (9/20) before scaling to degrees. \n\nThis aligns with a failure to recognize that pie chart angles depend on ratios between parts and the whole, not direct frequency-to-angle conversions. It differs from related misconceptions like multiplying frequency by 360\u00b0 (which would yield 9\u00d7360) or reversing the fraction (e.g., total/360 \u00d7 frequency), as the student\u2019s operation specifically inverts the role of the part and the whole in division.",
