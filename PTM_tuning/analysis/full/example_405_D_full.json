  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n1. Given ratio 5:3 (blue:yellow)\n2. Blue quantity = 1500ml = 5 parts\n3. Value per part = 1500ml \u00f7 5 = 300ml\n4. Yellow quantity = 300ml \u00d7 3 = 900ml\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\n1. Treated 1500ml as 1 part instead of 5 parts\n2. Directly multiplied by the ratio number: 1500ml \u00d7 3 = 4500ml\n\nReasoning Flaw:\nThe student misinterpreted the given blue quantity as representing 1 ratio part rather than 5 parts. This caused them to skip the critical step of calculating the value per part (300ml). By multiplying 1500ml directly by 3 (the yellow ratio number), they preserved the ratio's proportionality incorrectly.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nThis differs from errors like not scaling both ratio terms equally or miscalculating total parts, as the error specifically stems from misassigning the given quantity to a single ratio unit rather than its actual multiple. The student maintained ratio proportionality but with an incorrect base value per part.\n\nKey Misapplication:\nThe student applied multiplicative scaling (\u00d73) to the entire given quantity rather than first dividing to establish the correct unit value. This conflates the ratio's part-to-whole relationship with direct scalar multiplication.",
