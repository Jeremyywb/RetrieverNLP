  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The top horizontal length \\(3x + 4\\) equals the sum of the bottom horizontal segments: \\( \\bigstar + (x + 4) \\). Solving \\(3x + 4 = \\bigstar + x + 4\\) gives \\( \\bigstar = 2x \\).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely assumed the vertical segment labeled \"3\" (right partial height) directly corresponded to \\( \\bigstar \\), ignoring the horizontal relationship. \n\nReasoning flaw: The student treated the vertical dimension (3) as equivalent to the horizontal missing length \\( \\bigstar \\), failing to recognize that horizontal lengths must balance independently of vertical ones. \n\nMisconception link: This stems from not applying conservation of horizontal lengths in composite shapes, leading to conflating vertical and horizontal dimensions. \n\nDistinction: The error is not about variable handling (e.g., canceling terms) but a failure to isolate and equate horizontal components. The student prioritized a visible numerical value over structural relationships.",
