  "explanation": "The correct fractions require integer numerator and denominator. Tom's \\( \\frac{143}{2} \\) meets this requirement, while Katie's \\( \\frac{4.2}{9} \\) contains a decimal numerator. \n\nThe student likely concluded both answers were invalid by misapplying simplification rules to Tom's fraction. They might have incorrectly believed \\( \\frac{143}{2} \\) must be converted to a mixed number (71.5) to be \"simplified,\" thereby rejecting it as improperly formatted. \n\nThis stems from conflating stylistic preferences (like avoiding improper fractions) with validity requirements. The error directly matches the \"Confuses valid and invalid fractions\" misconception, as the student treated a legitimate fraction (\\( \\frac{143}{2} \\)) as invalid due to formatting rather than mathematical correctness. \n\nThis differs from \"Left expression unsimplified,\" which would involve failing to reduce fractions like \\( \\frac{4}{8} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), not rejecting valid forms. The student's core error was misidentifying valid fraction criteria, not simplification failures.",
