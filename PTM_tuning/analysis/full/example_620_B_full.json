  "explanation": "To correctly reflect point \\( C \\) over the line \\( x=4 \\), the x-coordinate is transformed using \\( x' = 2(4) - x \\), while the y-coordinate remains unchanged. If the original \\( C \\) was at \\( (6,5) \\), the reflection gives \\( x' = 8 - 6 = 2 \\), resulting in \\( (2,5) \\).\n\nThe student computed \\( (6,3) \\), keeping the x-coordinate at 6 but altering the y-coordinate to 3. This indicates they treated \\( x=4 \\) as a horizontal line \\( y=4 \\), reflecting vertically instead of horizontally. Specifically, they likely calculated \\( y' = 2(4) - 5 = 3 \\), mistakenly applying the reflection formula to the y-axis. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the vertical line \\( x=4 \\) as a horizontal line, causing them to invert the y-coordinate around 4 rather than the x-coordinate. This directly aligns with confusing the orientation of the mirror line. Unlike related misconceptions (e.g., translating or swapping axes), the error specifically shows the reflection axis was misassigned to the wrong dimension.",
