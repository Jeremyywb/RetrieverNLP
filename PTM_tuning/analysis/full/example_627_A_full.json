  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 9 \\times (-0.5) = -4.5 \\)\n\nIncorrect calculation: Student likely computed \\( 9 \\times 5 = 45 \\) (treating -0.5 as 5) and applied the negative sign to get -45\n\nThe student failed to account for the decimal place in 0.5, effectively multiplying 9 by 10\u00d7 the actual value of 0.5. By treating the decimal digit 5 as a whole number rather than 5 tenths, they produced a result scaled by an extra factor of 10. This matches the misconception of multiplying digits without decimal adjustment, as opposed to errors in decimal repositioning after multiplication. The error occurred at the initial multiplication step rather than during subsequent decimal placement adjustments.\n\nDistinct from related misconceptions: No evidence of division errors or decimal shifts after multiplication - the miscalculation stems directly from disregarding the decimal's positional value during the core operation.",
