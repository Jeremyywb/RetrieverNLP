  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires division: \\(108 \\div 4 = 27\\).  \nThe student likely computed \\(108 - 4 = 104\\), treating subtraction as the inverse of multiplication.  \nThis shows they conflated inverse operations, applying subtraction where division was needed to isolate the variable.  \nThe error stems from a failure to recognize that division (not subtraction) reverses multiplication in equations of the form \\(x \\times a = b\\).  \nThis differs from subtracting the divisor directly (e.g., \\(108 - 4\\) instead of \\(108 \\div 4\\)) rather than misapplying addition or misaligning operations entirely.  \nThe specific mismatch between the operation used and the required inverse operation distinguishes this error from other related misconceptions.",
