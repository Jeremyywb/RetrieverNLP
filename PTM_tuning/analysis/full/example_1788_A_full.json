  "explanation": "The correct value calculation requires multiplying the digit by its place value: 3 \u00d7 100,000 = 300,000.  \nThe student isolated the digit \"3\" without processing its position, resulting in an answer of \"3\".  \nThe error stems from treating the numeral as its face value rather than its positional weight in the number's structure.  \nThis occurs when the student fails to recognize that each digit's contribution scales with its placement in the multi-digit sequence.  \nThe misconception differs from misunderstanding zeros as placeholders, as the error specifically ignores multiplicative place value rather than misinterpreting zero's role.  \nIt also contrasts with confusing column labels (e.g., \"ones\"), since the error isn't about misnaming the place but omitting the scaling factor entirely.",
