  "explanation": "Correct calculation (units place):\n12 (after borrowing) - \u2605 = 3 \u2192 \u2605 = 12 - 3 = 9\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n2 - \u2605 = 3 (without borrowing) \u2192 \u2605 = 2 - 3 = -1 (invalid)\nThen incorrectly reversed operation: \u2605 - 2 = 3 \u2192 \u2605 = 5\n\nThe student treated subtraction as commutative by reversing the digits to avoid negative results. This allowed them to calculate \u2605 = 5 through \u2605 - 2 = 3 instead of recognizing the need to borrow. The error stems from assuming subtraction order can be swapped to make calculations easier, rather than applying borrowing rules. This directly matches the \"subtraction is commutative\" misconception, not borrowing or inverse operation errors which would produce different invalid digits like -1 or require different corrective steps.",
