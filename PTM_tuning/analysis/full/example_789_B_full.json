  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{3}{10} + \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}\\) (divided numerator/denominator by 2).  \nStudent's calculation: \\(\\frac{3}{10} + \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{8}{10}\\) (stopped here).  \n\nThe student correctly added numerators but failed to recognize \\(\\frac{8}{10}\\) could be simplified. They treated the sum as final despite both terms sharing a common factor of 2. This reflects a direct failure to apply fraction simplification when possible, not an incorrect simplification method.  \n\nThe error differs from related misconceptions because the student didn't alter the fraction incorrectly (e.g., adding/subtracting from numerator/denominator) - they simply omitted the required reduction step. The flaw lies exclusively in leaving the answer unsimplified after valid addition.",
