  "explanation": "The correct calculation: \\( \\sqrt[4]{16} = 2 \\) because \\( 2^4 = 16 \\).\n\nThe student likely computed: \\( 16 \\times 4 = 64 \\).\n\nThe error stems from interpreting the fourth root as multiplication by 4 instead of inverse exponentiation. The student treated the radical's index as a multiplier rather than identifying the base that produces 16 when raised to the 4th power. This aligns with confusing root operations with direct arithmetic operations (multiplication), not merely misapplying exponents or squaring. Unlike confusing exponents with results (e.g., answering \"4\"), the error specifically substitutes multiplicative reasoning for exponential relationships.",
