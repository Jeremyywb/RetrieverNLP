  "explanation": "The correct calculation applies the commutative property to each multiplication term separately: \\( y \\times x = x y \\) and \\( b \\times 3 = 3 b \\), then combines them as \\( x y + 3 b \\). \n\nThe student incorrectly treated \\( y \\times x + b \\times 3 \\) as a single multiplication sequence, collapsing all elements into \\( 3 b x y \\). \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the structure of the expression: the \"+\" operator separates the terms \\( y \\times x \\) and \\( b \\times 3 \\), but the student multiplied all numerical/alphabetic components together. This reflects a failure to recognize distinct terms in the expression and their additive relationship. \n\nThe misconception aligns with multiplying all visible numbers/variables without analyzing their context (e.g., addition separating terms). It is distinct from purely misapplying the commutative property (which would involve term order within a product) or left-to-right calculation (which would preserve addition but miscalculate priorities).",
