  "explanation": "The correct answer identifies line KJ as a transversal because it intersects two parallel lines. The student incorrectly labeled it as \"skew,\" which describes non-parallel, non-intersecting lines in different planes. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying spatial reasoning: the student likely focused on KJ's diagonal orientation relative to the parallel lines, associating angular positioning with skewness. However, skew lines must exist in separate planes and never intersect - conditions not met here since KJ visibly crosses both parallel lines in the same plane. \n\nThis aligns with the primary misconception of judging relationships through positional appearance rather than verifying coplanarity and intersection requirements. Unlike confusion about perpendicularity or angle rules, this error specifically involves misclassifying intersecting coplanar lines as non-coplanar skew lines based solely on their angular arrangement.",
