  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nConvert all terms to sixths:\n2/3 k\u00b2 = 4/6 k\u00b2\n1/6 k\u00b2 = 1/6 k\u00b2\n-1/3 k\u00b2 = -2/6 k\u00b2\n5/6 k\u00b2 = 5/6 k\u00b2\n\nSum numerators: 4 + 1 - 2 + 5 = 8\nResult: 8/6 k\u00b2 = 4/3 k\u00b2 = 1\u202f1/3 k\u00b2\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nTreated denominators as irrelevant after conversion:\n4 (from 4/6) + 1 (from 1/6) - 2 (from -2/6) + 5 (from 5/6) = 8\nReported 8 k\u00b2 (then incorrectly simplified to 2 k\u00b2 via unexplained division)\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student removed denominators entirely after making equivalent fractions, interpreting converted numerators (4, 1, -2, 5) as whole numbers rather than parts of fractions. This caused them to sum raw integers (8) instead of maintaining the 1/6 scale, leading to an inflated coefficient.\n\nDistinction:\nThis differs from adding numerators/denominators separately (which would yield 7/18 k\u00b2) or ignoring negative signs (which would produce 12/6 = 2 k\u00b2 directly). The error specifically stems from discarding denominators after alignment rather than misapplying operations on signed numbers.",
