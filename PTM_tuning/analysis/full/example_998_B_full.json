  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( c + a \\) remains as is because \\( c \\) and \\( a \\) are unlike terms and cannot be combined through addition or subtraction.\n\nStudent's error: They rewrote \\( c + a \\) as \\( a c \\), treating addition as multiplication.\n\nFlaw in reasoning: The student incorrectly interpreted the \"+\" operator as an instruction to concatenate the variables into a product. This indicates they conflated the notation for addition with the notation for multiplication, believing variables written adjacently (e.g., \\( a c \\)) represent addition rather than multiplication.\n\nConnection to misconception: This directly stems from misapplying operational symbols: they assumed combining terms through addition requires merging their variables, a misunderstanding of how algebraic operations are notated. \n\nDistinguishing from related errors: Unlike confusing like terms or attempting invalid addition, this error specifically misapplies the multiplication convention (adjacent variables) to an addition operation, rather than failing to recognize term compatibility.",
