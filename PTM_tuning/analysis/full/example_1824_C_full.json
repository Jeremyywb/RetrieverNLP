  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \nYear 7 Chinese students (specific segment value) - Year 8 Chinese students (specific segment value) = 35.\n\nStudent's likely calculation: \nUsed the total height of Year 7's bar (summing all language groups) = 85, then either:\n1) Assumed this total represented Chinese alone, or\n2) Failed to subtract Year 8's Chinese count.\n\nFlaw explanation: \nThe student misinterpreted the composite bar chart by treating the full bar height as representing Chinese enrollment alone, rather than identifying the specific Chinese segment within each year group's bar. This caused them to incorrectly attribute all Year 7 students (across languages) to Chinese studies, resulting in an inflated value of 85.\n\nDistinction from related errors: \nThis differs from subtraction neglect because the core error lies in misreading the chart's structure, not in forgetting to calculate a difference. The 85 value directly corresponds to a whole bar measurement, not an arithmetic operation between correct segment values.",
