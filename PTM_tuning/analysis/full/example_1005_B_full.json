  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3 \u00f7 5 = 0.6 \\)\n\nIncorrect calculation: Student likely treated the numerator as the decimal value directly, writing \\( 0.3 \\) instead of performing division.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student incorrectly converted the numerator to the decimal portion without accounting for the denominator's role in determining place value. This stems from misapplying the relationship between numerator and denominator in positional notation.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error matches the pattern of treating the numerator as sufficient to determine the decimal value, bypassing the required division operation. This differs from related misconceptions (e.g., swapping division order or using the denominator numerically) because the student preserved the numerator's position but neglected the denominator's scaling function.\n\nDistinction: Unlike errors involving denominator placement (\\( 0.5 \\)) or inverted division (\\( 5 \u00f7 3 \\)), this error specifically isolates the numerator as the sole decimal component.",
