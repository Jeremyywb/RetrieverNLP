  "explanation": "Correct expansion: \\((x-4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16\\) via \\((x-4)(x-4) = x^2 -4x -4x +16\\).  \nStudent's incorrect step: Calculating \\(x^2 + (-4)^2 = x^2 + 16\\), omitting \\(-8x\\).  \n\nThe student treated \\((x-4)^2\\) as the sum of squared terms rather than expanding the product fully. This reflects a failure to apply the distributive property to all terms, specifically omitting the cross-term \\(-4x -4x\\). The error stems from assuming squaring a binomial is equivalent to squaring individual terms and summing them, bypassing the necessary intermediate multiplications.  \n\nThis aligns with the misconception that \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\\), distinct from errors like miscomputing coefficients or partial multiplication (e.g., only multiplying first terms, which would not produce both \\(x^2\\) and \\(16\\)). The exclusion of cross-terms uniquely identifies this specific reasoning flaw.",
