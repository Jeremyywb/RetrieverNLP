  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n(5\u00d74 + 6\u00d79 + 7\u00d79 + 8\u00d73) \u00f7 25  \n= (20 + 54 + 63 + 24) \u00f7 25  \n= 161 \u00f7 25 = 6.44\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n(5+6+7+8 +4+9+9+3) \u00f7 4  \n= 51 \u00f7 4 = 12.75  \n*Or* (5+6+7+8) \u00d7 (4+9+9+3) \u00f7 4  \n= 26 \u00d7 25 \u00f7 4 = 162.5 (rounding difference)\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student treated all table entries as individual data points (summing spots and frequencies together) rather than pairing them for weighted calculation. This caused them to divide by the number of categories (4 rows) instead of the total count (25 ladybirds). The error stems from misinterpreting the table structure and failing to apply frequency weighting, directly aligning with the primary misconception of raw number addition without frequency consideration. This differs from related misconceptions about dividing by category sums, as the student's divisor matches the number of rows, not mathematical category totals.\n\nKey distinction:\nWhile related misconceptions involve division by category sums, this specific error shows division by table row count - a more fundamental misunderstanding of frequency table interpretation.",
