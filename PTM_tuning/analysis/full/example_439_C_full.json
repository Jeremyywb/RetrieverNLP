  "explanation": "The correct reasoning shows quadrilaterals can only have rotational symmetry of order 1, 2, or 4. For example:\n- A general quadrilateral (order 1)\n- A rectangle (order 2)\n- A square (order 4)\n\nThe student incorrectly accepted order 3 symmetry by assuming rotational symmetry aligns with polygon characteristics. Their reasoning likely followed:\n1. \"Triangles have order 3 symmetry when regular\"\n2. \"Quadrilaterals might have different symmetry orders too\"\n3. \"Therefore, some quadrilaterals could have order 3\"\n\nThe flaw stems from transferring rotational symmetry patterns between polygon families (triangles \u2192 quadrilaterals) rather than analyzing geometric constraints. This directly matches the misconception that polygon properties like side count dictate symmetry order, even though rotational symmetry requires angle divisibility and congruence that make order 3 geometrically impossible for quadrilaterals.\n\nThis differs from \"assumes symmetry without evidence\" because the error specifically involves transferring expectations from one polygon type to another (3-sided\u21924-sided) rather than making arbitrary claims. It also differs from \"gives one fewer order\" errors because the miscalculation originates in category-based assumptions rather than counting mistakes.",
