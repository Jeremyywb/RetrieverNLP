  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the given coordinates: At 30 mph (x=30), the graph directly shows y=7 hours. \n\nThe student likely counted grid squares from the origin to the point (30,7), assuming each square equals 1 unit on both axes. If the x-axis scale is compressed (e.g., 2 mph per square), 30 mph would span 15 squares horizontally. Mistaking squares for units, they misread the y-coordinate as 15 instead of using the actual y-axis scale.\n\nThis error stems from treating grid squares as equivalent to numerical units rather than interpreting the axis scales. The misconception is specifically about scale interpretation, not general estimation or misidentifying the graph's shape. Related misconceptions like assuming a straight-line graph or incorrect reciprocal reasoning don't apply here, as the error is purely in scale translation.",
