  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Between 0 (1st dash) and 2 (9th dash) there are 8 intervals. Each interval equals \\( \\frac{2}{8} = 0.25 \\). The 7th dash is 6 intervals from 0: \\( 6 \\times 0.25 = 1.5 \\).\n\nStudent's error: They likely computed \\( 6 \\times 0.3 = 1.8 \\), assuming intervals of 0.3 units. This occurred because they divided the total length (2) by 6.666... instead of 8 intervals, possibly misaligning dash counts with interval counts. \n\nSpecific flaw: The student incorrectly associated the 9 dashes with fewer intervals (e.g., treating dashes as interval markers rather than boundaries), leading to an overestimated interval size. This directly corresponds to misinterpreting how dashes map to scale divisions.\n\nDistinction: Unlike estimation errors or dash miscounts, this error stems from misderiving the interval size through incorrect division of total length by an assumed number of segments, not mere counting mistakes or approximations.",
