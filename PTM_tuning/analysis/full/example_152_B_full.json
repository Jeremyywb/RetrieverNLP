  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n5050 has ones digit 0. When rounding to nearest 10:  \n5050 \u2192 5050 (no change as 0 < 5 in ones place)\n\nStudent's error:  \nThey likely examined the tens digit (5) instead of the ones digit. Reasoning:  \n\"Since the tens digit is 5, round up the hundreds place\" \u2192 5050 \u2192 5100\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student incorrectly treated the tens digit (5) as the deciding digit for rounding to 10s, rather than the ones digit. This caused them to erroneously increment the hundreds place by 1, altering multiple digits.\n\nConnection to misconception:  \nThey conflated the role of place values, applying a rounding rule for higher place values (hundreds) to the tens digit. This aligns with misapplying rounding rules when the result could be a multiple of 100.\n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis isn't merely rounding \"too little\" or misreading place values entirely, but specifically misidentifying which digit governs the rounding operation for the specified accuracy.",
