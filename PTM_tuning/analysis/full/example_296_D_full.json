  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The discriminant requires evaluating \\( (-3)^2 - 4(5)(-2) \\). This becomes \\( 9 - (-40) = 9 + 40 = 49 \\).\n\nStudent's error: They likely computed \\( 9 - (-40) \\) as \\( 9 - 40 \\) instead of \\( 9 + 40 \\), resulting in \\( -31 \\).\n\nFlaw explanation: The student treated subtraction of a negative number as equivalent to subtracting its absolute value. This caused them to incorrectly convert \\( -(-40) \\) into a subtraction of 40 rather than an addition.\n\nConnection to misconception: This directly aligns with the listed misconception where \"subtracting a negative adds the absolute values but writes the answer with a negative sign,\" since they transformed \\( 9 - (-40) \\) into \\( 9 - 40 \\).\n\nDistinction from others: The error isn't about squaring negatives (since \\( (-3)^2=9 \\) is correct) or commutative subtraction (order of operations was preserved). The core issue is mishandling the double negative.",
