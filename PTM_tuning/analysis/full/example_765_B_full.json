  "explanation": "The correct answer requires identifying a 3D shape with two congruent triangular bases connected by rectangular lateral faces. The student selected a cylinder, which has circular bases and a curved surface. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the concept of uniform cross-section. While cylinders do have a consistent circular cross-section, the student failed to recognize that prisms specifically require polygonal bases and flat lateral faces. This confusion conflates the general concept of uniform cross-sections (applicable to cylinders) with the stricter prism definition requiring polygon-based cross-sections. \n\nThe primary flaw is the conflation of circular cross-sections (allowed for cylinders) with triangular prisms' requirement for triangular polygon cross-sections. This distinguishes the error from related misconceptions like not understanding 3D properties - the student recognized dimensionality but misclassified the geometric constraints.",
