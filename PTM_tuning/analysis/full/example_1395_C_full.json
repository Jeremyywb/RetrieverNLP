  "explanation": "The correct determination of parallel lines relies on equal gradients. For Tom's lines \\( y = 5x + 7 \\) and \\( y = 3x + 7 \\), the gradients (5 and 3) differ, so they are not parallel. Katie's lines \\( y = 5x + 7 \\) and \\( y = 5x - 22 \\) share the gradient 5, making them parallel. \n\nThe student incorrectly concluded both pairs are parallel. Their error likely stemmed from observing that Tom's lines have the same y-intercept (7) and assuming this makes them parallel, while correctly recognizing Katie's lines share the same gradient. This aligns with prioritizing identical y-intercepts over gradients for parallelism. \n\nThe misconception directly caused the student to equate identical y-intercepts with parallelism in Tom's case, despite differing gradients. This is distinct from confusing \\( c \\) (y-intercept) for the gradient in \\( y = mx + c \\), which would involve misinterpreting the coefficient roles rather than misapplying the parallel condition.",
