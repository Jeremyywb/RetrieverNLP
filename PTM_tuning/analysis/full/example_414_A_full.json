  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nSoup (\u00a33.19) + Coffee (\u00a31.95) = \u00a35.14 total cost  \n\u00a320.00 - \u00a35.14 = \u00a314.86 change\n\nStudent's calculation:\n\u00a33.19 + \u00a31.95 = \u00a35.14 (taken as final answer)\n\nThe student correctly calculated the total cost but failed to subtract it from \u00a320. This indicates they confused \"total cost\" with \"change received,\" directly substituting addition for the required subtraction step. The error stems from misinterpreting the problem's final operation (\"change from f20\" requires subtraction) after correctly executing the initial addition. This aligns with adding instead of subtracting in word problems, not with calculation errors or BIDMAS issues. The answer format (\u00a35.14) matches the intermediate sum, showing they stopped at the total cost calculation rather than progressing to the final subtraction.",
