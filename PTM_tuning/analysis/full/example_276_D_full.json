  "explanation": "The correct calculation identifies \\( P' \\) as all elements not in set P. From the Venn diagram: crisps (only in P), sweets (in P\u2229Q), pizza (only in Q), chocolate (outside both). Thus, \\( P' \\) = {pizza, chocolate}.\n\nThe student included \"sweets\" in \\( P' \\). Their error stems from treating \\( P' \\) as elements not exclusively in P, rather than elements entirely outside P. Since sweets belong to P (via the intersection), they cannot be in \\( P' \\). The flaw lies in misdefining the complement as \"elements not unique to P\" instead of \"elements absent from P entirely.\" This aligns with the primary misconception of misunderstanding complement notation, not merely including non-P elements (which pizza/chocolate correctly do). The related misconception of \"including all elements not in the set\" doesn\u2019t apply here, as the student correctly excluded crisps but erroneously retained sweets due to misclassifying shared elements.",
