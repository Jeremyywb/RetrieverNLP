  "explanation": "The problem involves identifying parallel sides in a trapezium, typically marked with arrows. The correct reasoning recognizes arrow notation as indicating parallelism, not equal length. The student likely observed these arrows but misinterpreted them as signifying equal length instead of parallel orientation. This directly corresponds to the misconception where symbolic markings for parallelism are confused with length equality. The error is distinct from believing equal length implies parallelism (which would require comparing side measurements) or misinterpreting dash markings (which typically denote length equality), as the problem explicitly involves arrow notation for parallelism. The student's focus on symbolic meaning, rather than geometric properties, caused the incorrect conclusion.",
