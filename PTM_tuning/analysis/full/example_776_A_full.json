  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 8 intervals between 0 and 2 (9 dashes), each interval = \\( \\frac{2}{8} = 0.25 \\). The 8th dash is 7 intervals from 0: \\( 7 \\times 0.25 = 1.75 \\).\n\nStudent's error: Calculated \\( 6 \\times 0.25 = 1.5 \\), assuming 6 intervals instead of 7.\n\nFlaw: The student misapplied the correct scale (0.25 per interval) but incorrectly counted the intervals. They subtracted 2 from the dash number (8 - 2 = 6) rather than recognizing intervals = dashes - 1. This reflects a misinterpretation of how dashes map to intervals on a numbered line.\n\nDistinction: Unlike scale misreadings (e.g., assuming dashes represent 0.1), the student correctly identified the interval size but failed to associate dashes with their corresponding intervals. The error stems from a misalignment in counting, not a misunderstanding of decimal increments or midpoints.",
