  "explanation": "Correct solution requires discriminant \\( D = b^2 - 4ac < 0 \\), yielding imaginary roots. The student's answer shows \\( D = 0 \\), which produces a single real root at \\( x = -2 \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly associated \\( \\sqrt{0} \\) with \"no solution\" rather than recognizing \\( \\sqrt{0} = 0 \\) still produces \\( \\frac{-6}{3} = -2 \\). This stems from thinking square roots require strictly positive radicands, misinterpreting zero's validity in the radical.\n\nThe error directly matches the misconception that 0 has no square root. Unlike general negative-root avoidance (which would preserve valid solutions when \\( D \\geq 0 \\)), this specific flaw invalidates a mathematically permissible zero-radical case.\n\nNo connection exists to misremembered formulas or solution-at-zero beliefs, as the quadratic formula structure remains intact and solutions aren't claimed to be zero.",
