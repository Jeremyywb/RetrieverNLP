  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nThe sequence decreases by 8 each term, giving a common difference \\( d = -8 \\). The general formula is \\( T(n) = a + (n-1)d \\). Substituting \\( a = 94 \\) and \\( d = -8 \\):\n\\[\nT(n) = 94 + (n-1)(-8) = 94 - 8n + 8 = -8n + 102.\n\\]\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\nThe student likely identified the magnitude of the difference (8) but treated it as positive. They then set \\( T(n) = 8n + b \\) and solved for \\( b \\) using \\( n=1 \\):\n\\[\n94 = 8(1) + b \\implies b = 86,\n\\]\nresulting in \\( T(n) = 8n + 86 \\).\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student assumed the coefficient of \\( n \\) must be positive, ignoring the sequence's decreasing nature. This led them to use \\( +8 \\) instead of \\( -8 \\). They then forced the formula to fit the first term, creating a mismatch for subsequent terms.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThis directly stems from the belief that gradients (differences) in linear sequences cannot be negative. The student preserved the magnitude of the difference but discarded its sign, prioritizing positivity over directional accuracy.\n\nDistinguishing from related errors:\nThe error is not about misassigning the first term as the coefficient (which would yield \\( 94n \\)) or commutative subtraction. The focus is strictly on invalidating negative gradients, not miscomputing the constant term independently.",
