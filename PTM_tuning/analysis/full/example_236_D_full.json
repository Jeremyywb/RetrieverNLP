  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Multiply all dimensions after unit conversion (\\(7 \\times 5 \\times 6\\)).  \nStudent's calculation: Added the dimensions (\\(7+5+6\\)).  \n\nThe student converted 60mm to 6cm correctly but treated the volume formula as a sum rather than a product. This directly stems from conflating the concept of \"total\" quantity with addition, even when three-dimensional measurement requires multiplication. The error specifically replaces the necessary multiplicative relationship between dimensions with additive combination, distinct from area-related errors (which would involve two dimensions) or general confusion about prisms. The identical numerical values in both operations confirm the substitution of addition for multiplication, not a procedural misstep in unit conversion or formula selection.",
