  "explanation": "The correct solution requires both inequalities to hold strictly. For (1,3):  \n1) \\(1+3=4 > 2\\)  \n2) \\(1 < 3\\).  \n\nThe student selected (1,1), where:  \n1) \\(1+1=2 \\not> 2\\)  \n2) \\(1 \\not< 1\\).  \n\nThe student treated \"2 < x+y\" as allowing equality (accepting \\(x+y=2\\)) and interpreted \"x < y\" as permitting equality (allowing \\(x=y\\)). This shows they conflated strict inequalities with non-strict ones, believing the inequalities included equality.  \n\nThis directly aligns with the primary misconception of misunderstanding strict inequality notation. Related misconceptions like symbol reversal don't apply here, as the student preserved the inequality directions but misjudged their strictness.",
