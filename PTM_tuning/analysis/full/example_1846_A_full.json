  "explanation": "The correct nth-term rule is \\(\\frac{1}{24}n\\), requiring \\(+0\\) because substituting \\(n=1\\) yields \\(\\frac{1}{24}(1) = \\frac{1}{24}\\), matching the first term. \n\nThe student likely calculated the common difference (\\(\\frac{1}{24}\\)) correctly but incorrectly treated it as both the coefficient **and** an additive constant. They wrote \\(\\frac{1}{24}n + \\frac{1}{24}\\), erroneously adding the first term's value. \n\nThis stems from conflating the term-to-term rule (common difference) with the need for an explicit constant term. The student assumed the formula requires the first term to be added after scaling \\(n\\) by the common difference, failing to recognize that the coefficient alone already accounts for the sequence's linear growth. \n\nThis error aligns with the misconception of treating the term-to-term difference as both the coefficient and part of the constant term, distinct from errors like misidentifying the coefficient as the first term or miscalculating the 0th term. The student's reasoning duplicated the common difference instead of validating the formula through substitution.",
