  "explanation": "The quadratic formula's denominator requires multiplying the leading coefficient \\(a=3\\) by 2: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\). \n\nThe student likely calculated \\(2 + 3 = 5\\), treating the multiplication \\(2a\\) as addition. \n\nThis error stems from interpreting the operation between 2 and \\(a\\) as addition instead of multiplication. The mistake specifically occurs when translating the formula's \"2a\" into an arithmetic step, replacing the required product with a sum. \n\nThis aligns with misapplying operations in formula components, not with adding unrelated terms like coefficients and constants (e.g., \\(3 + 4\\)) or conflating exponents with addition. The direct substitution of addition for multiplication in the denominator uniquely explains the incorrect result 5.",
