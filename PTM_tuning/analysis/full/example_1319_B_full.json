  "explanation": "Correct calculation shows consecutive numbers require a constant difference of 1: \\(n\\), \\(n+1\\), \\(n+2\\). The student's \\(n\\), \\(2n\\), \\(3n\\) produces terms with differences of \\(n\\) (e.g., if \\(n=5\\), differences are 5 and 5, not 1). \n\nThe error stems from treating term positions as multiplicative coefficients rather than applying additive increments. The student incorrectly assumed multiplying \\(n\\) by 1, 2, 3 (term positions) would create consecutive values, conflating term numbering with required additive relationships. \n\nThis directly aligns with confusing additive and multiplicative relationships: they used \\(2n\\) (doubling \\(n\\)) instead of \\(n+1\\) (adding 1). It differs from geometric sequence confusion because the student's sequence isn't geometric (ratios between \\(2n/n=2\\) and \\(3n/2n=1.5\\) aren't consistent), showing they prioritized positional multipliers over additive steps. \n\nTesting \\(n=2\\) reveals the flaw: the student's sequence becomes 2, 4, 6 (non-consecutive), while the correct answer yields 2, 3, 4. The misconception caused them to misapply multiplication where addition was necessary to maintain a fixed difference.",
