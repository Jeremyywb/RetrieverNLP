  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Each of the 8 equal pie chart sections represents \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\) people. Red occupies 2 sections: \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\).\n\nStudent's error: They likely counted the 2 red sections directly as 2 people without converting sections to proportional quantities. This shows they treated the count of pie chart segments as literal frequencies rather than fractional parts of the whole.\n\nThe flaw stems from misinterpreting categorical data representation in pie charts. The student conflated the number of sections (a visual division) with the absolute count, skipping the critical step of multiplying by the value per section. This matches the primary misconception of not understanding how to translate pie chart segments to numerical data.\n\nThis differs from estimating instead of calculating (the answer is exact if sections are counted) or degree-per-person errors (no angle measures are mentioned). The error specifically involves failing to recognize that each section's count requires scaling by the total divided by the number of sections.",
