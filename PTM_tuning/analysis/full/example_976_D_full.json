  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires multiplying each number of pets by its frequency (e.g., 0\u00d74, 1\u00d76, etc.) and summing these products. The student's answer suggests they subtracted frequency values from the number of pets (e.g., 0\u22124, 1\u22126) instead of multiplying. This indicates they misinterpreted the relationship between the columns, treating them as quantities to combine through subtraction rather than factors to multiply for total counts. The error specifically stems from misapplying subtraction as the operation to combine discrete counts with their frequencies, rather than recognizing multiplication as the method to scale counts by occurrence. This aligns with the subtraction misconception rather than related division or addition errors, as the operation chosen directly contradicts the required multiplicative aggregation for frequency tables.",
