  "explanation": "To write 107 correctly: The digits represent 1 hundred (100), 0 tens (0), and 7 ones (7), forming \"one hundred and seven.\" \n\nThe student's answer \"ten seven\" implies they interpreted the digits as 10 (from the first two digits \"1\" and \"0\") followed by 7. This error stems from misassigning place values: They treated the hundreds digit (1) as part of the tens place, combining it with the tens digit (0) to form \"10,\" then appended the ones digit. \n\nThis directly reflects a failure to associate digits with their correct positional values. The student conflated the hundreds and tens places, bypassing the structure where each digit occupies a distinct column (hundreds, tens, ones). \n\nDistinguishing from related misconceptions: The error isn't due to reading digits right-to-left (which would yield \"seven zero one\") or ignoring zeros (the zero is used here to form \"10\"). Instead, the core flaw is misaligning digits to their place values.",
