  "explanation": "The correct solution reverses the operations: starting with 9, divide by 2 (yielding 4.5), then subtract 1 (resulting in 3.5). The student likely performed \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\) followed by \\(18 + 1 = 19\\), applying the original operations in their given order rather than their inverses in reverse. This reflects a failure to recognize that solving for the input requires undoing the output's operations sequentially. The error aligns with applying forward operations instead of inverses, distinct from input/output confusion (which would involve reversing roles without operational errors) or order reversal (which would yield \\( (9 - 1)/2 = 4 \\)). The key flaw is misapplying the sequence as given, not merely swapping steps.",
