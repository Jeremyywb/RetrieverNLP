  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 17 \\, \\text{cm} \\div 5 = 3.4 \\, \\text{cm} \\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\( 17 \\, \\text{cm} - 5 = 12 \\, \\text{cm} \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly subtracted the number of sides (5) from the total perimeter (17) instead of dividing. This substitution of subtraction for division directly caused the error. The problem requires distributing the total length equally across all sides, which necessitates division. The misconception of conflating \"total\" with \"remove one quantity from another\" led to this operation mismatch.  \n\nThis error aligns with subtraction-for-division confusion rather than misunderstanding \"regular\" (which would prevent recognizing equal sides are needed) or arithmetic errors with divisors. The specific use of subtraction here, not mere arithmetic mishandling, confirms the core flaw.",
