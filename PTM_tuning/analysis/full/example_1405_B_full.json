  "explanation": "The correct equation is determined by noting the x-axis has 5 intervals from -10 to 0, each representing 2 units (total 10 units \u00f7 5 intervals = 2 per interval). The vertical line is one interval right of -10: \\(-10 + 2 = -8\\), so \\(x = -8\\).\n\nThe student likely counted the first line after -10 as -9, assuming each grid line increments by 1. This implies they treated the 5 intervals between -10 and 0 as 5 units total (1 per interval), not recognizing the actual scale of 2 units per interval.\n\nThis error directly stems from misinterpreting the axis scale: they assigned 1 unit per grid interval instead of calculating the true scale. The misconception is distinct from counting lines instead of gaps (which would involve miscalculating differences) or misaligning the line with the nearest marked value (e.g., -10 itself). Here, the flaw is scale misidentification, not spatial miscounting.",
