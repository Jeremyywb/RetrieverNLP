This reflects confusion between additive decomposition (used in expanded form addition) and multiplicative operations, where place value positions must remain aligned to ensure proper digit-by-digit multiplication and carrying. The error stems from applying place value separation horizontally across columns instead of vertically within columns, which would prevent proper calculation of partial products. This differs from related factor-splitting misconceptions because the error specifically involves improper physical arrangement of digits rather than miscalculating within columns or confusing multiplication properties.",
