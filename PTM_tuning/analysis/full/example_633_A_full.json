  "explanation": "The correct next step involves taking the square root of both sides, yielding \\( d+3 = \\pm 5 \\).  \nThe student wrote \\( d+3 = 5 \\), omitting the negative root.  \nThe error stems from assuming the square root of \\( 25 \\) must produce only the positive solution.  \nThis reflects a failure to recognize that squaring a negative number also produces a positive result, necessitating both roots when reversing the operation.  \nThe omission distinguishes this from related misconceptions (e.g., inability to handle imaginary roots), as the equation explicitly permits real solutions.  \nThe student\u2019s reasoning narrowed the square root\u2019s output to a single positive value, directly causing the incomplete solution.",
