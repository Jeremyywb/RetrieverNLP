  "explanation": "The correct method first calculates the original side's length (\u221a10) and slope (-1/3). To verify potential vertices:\n- From (3,1) to Tom's (2,-2): Distance \u221a10, slope 3 (perpendicular to original slope)\n- From (0,2) to Katie's (1,5): Distance \u221a10, slope 3 (perpendicular to original slope)\n\nThe student likely only checked axis-aligned movements. For example, they might have:\n1) Calculated horizontal/vertical distances between points (e.g., 3 units right from (0,2) to (3,1))\n2) Looked for new vertices maintaining these horizontal/vertical relationships\n3) Rejected both (2,-2) and (1,5) as \"not matching\" this grid pattern\n\nThis shows the student assumed squares must maintain cardinal directions, failing to recognize rotated squares can have diagonal sides. They didn't apply slope relationships for perpendicularity (m\u2081\u00d7m\u2082=-1) or verify matching lengths through distance formula. The error stems specifically from requiring horizontal/vertical alignment, not from miscalculations with coordinates or gradients.",
