  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n(5\u00d74 + 6\u00d79 + 7\u00d79 + 8\u00d73) / (4+9+9+3) = (20+54+63+24)/25 = 161/25 = 6.44\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n(4+9+9+3) / (5+6+7+8) = 25/26 \u2248 0.96\n\nFlawed reasoning:\nThe student divided total frequency (25) by the sum of the \"number of spots\" column (26) instead of dividing total spots (161) by total frequency. This reverses the required numerator and denominator for the mean.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThey confused the roles of the variable (spots) and frequency columns, treating the spots as frequencies and vice versa. This aligns with the misconception of column confusion rather than simply misapplying division direction.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis isn't a case of dividing by rows (4) or total spots (26) alone, but specifically inverting the correct ratio due to misidentifying which column represents values vs. counts.",
