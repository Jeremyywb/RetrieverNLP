  "explanation": "The correct representation of 107 is \"one hundred and seven,\" where the 7 occupies the ones place. The student wrote \"one hundred and seventy,\" erroneously assigning 7 to the tens place (as 70). \n\nThe error occurred when the student interpreted the digit 7 in the ones position as representing 70 (tens place value) instead of 7. This directly stems from misaligning the digit's position with its corresponding place value. \n\nThe misconception manifests as a failure to associate the digit 7 with its correct numerical weight (7 units) in the ones column. This differs from confusing numeral order (e.g., writing \"701\" as \"107\") or misidentifying \"teen\" numbers (e.g., confusing \"seventeen\" with \"seventy\"). Instead, the error specifically stems from improper grouping of digits into tens and units, misassigning the 7's positional value.",
