  "explanation": "To solve \\(0.4x - 3 = -1\\) graphically, one locates where \\(y = 0.4x - 3\\) intersects \\(y = -1\\). The correct solution \\(x = 5\\) is the x-coordinate of this intersection. The student likely substituted the constant term \\(-1\\) directly into \\(x\\), concluding \\(x = -1\\). This error stems from misinterpreting the equation's constant as the solution for \\(x\\) instead of recognizing it as the \\(y\\)-value to locate on the graph. The misconception aligns with treating the equation's numerical result as a direct assignment to \\(x\\), bypassing the graphical relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This differs from axis-swapping errors, as the student used the correct variable assignment but failed to translate the equation into its graphical representation.",
