  "explanation": "Correct Approach:\nStarting with \\(4v + 1 = 9v - 3\\):\n1. Subtract \\(4v\\) from both sides: \\(1 = 5v - 3\\), or\n2. Add \\(3\\) to both sides: \\(4v + 4 = 9v\\) (Katie's correct step).\n\nTom's Incorrect Step:\nTom's equation \\(5v + 1 = -3\\) implies he subtracted \\(4v\\) from the left but incorrectly added \\(4v\\) to the right side instead of subtracting it. This transforms the original equation into \\(1 = 9v - 3 + 4v\\) (equivalent to \\(1 = 13v - 3\\)), but he erroneously simplified this to \\(5v + 1 = -3\\).\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nTom misapplied sign rules when moving terms. He likely assumed subtracting \\(4v\\) from the left required adding \\(4v\\) to the right (changing its sign incorrectly), rather than subtracting \\(4v\\) from both sides equally. This violates the balance principle of equations, where inverse operations must be applied identically to both sides.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nThis is distinct from general inverse-operation errors (e.g., using multiplication instead of division) or misapplying operations to only one term. The error specifically stems from reversing the sign of a term during transposition while failing to maintain equality, not from misidentifying inverse operations or unbalanced operations.\n\nThe student accepted both answers because they didn't recognize Tom's violation of the equality principle when manipulating terms.",
