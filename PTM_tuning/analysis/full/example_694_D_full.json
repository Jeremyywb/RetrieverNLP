  "explanation": "The correct calculation multiplies numerators and denominators separately:\n(1\u00d72)/(s\u00d7t) = 2/st\n\nThe student likely performed:\n(1+2)/(s\u00d7t) = 3/st\n\nThe error stems from adding numerators (1+2) instead of multiplying them (1\u00d72), while correctly multiplying denominators. This shows a misapplication of fraction multiplication rules, where addition replaces multiplication specifically for numerators. The misconception matches \"adds numerators when multiplying fractions\" rather than other listed errors like adding denominators or confusing fraction operations (e.g., using addition rules for multiplication tasks). The student preserved correct denominator multiplication, distinguishing this from related errors involving denominator addition.",
