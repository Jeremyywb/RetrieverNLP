  "explanation": "The equation \\( t^{2} - 8t + 16 = 0 \\) factors to \\( (t - 4)^{2} = 0 \\), yielding one solution (\\( t = 4 \\)). \n\nThe student incorrectly selected \\( t^{2} - 16 = 0 \\), which factors to \\( (t - 4)(t + 4) = 0 \\), giving two solutions (\\( t = 4 \\) and \\( t = -4 \\)). \n\nThe student likely attempted to factor \\( t^{2} - 16 \\) but placed the constant term (16) directly into the factors without taking its square root first. For example, writing \\( (t - 16)(t + 16) = 0 \\), incorrectly believing this to be valid factorization. This error would lead them to incorrectly conclude that \\( t = 16 \\) is the only solution, misapplying the zero product property. \n\nThe flaw stems from misunderstanding how to factor a difference of squares: the constant term must be square-rooted before placing it in the binomials. This directly aligns with the misconception of retaining the original constant term during factorization. \n\nThis explanation distinguishes from the related misconception of ignoring negative roots, as the error here is rooted in faulty factoring, not in solving \\( t^{2} = 16 \\).",
