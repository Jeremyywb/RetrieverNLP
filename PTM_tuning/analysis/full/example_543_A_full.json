  "explanation": "The correct reflection would place the triangle's base 2 squares below the reflection line (mirroring the original 2 squares above), inverted vertically. Tom's reflection incorrectly places the base 3 squares below (distance error) while keeping the orientation upright. Katie's reflection inverts orientation (correctly) but erroneously places the base on the line (distance error). \n\nThe student accepted Tom's answer because they focused solely on preserving upright orientation, mistakenly equating reflection with a vertical translation rather than a flip. This shows they conflated reflection with sliding the shape parallel to the mirror line, ignoring both the required inversion and precise distance measurement. \n\nThe error aligns with a failure to recognize reflection as a \"flip,\" not just displacement. While Katie's orientation change might suggest awareness of flipping, the student dismissed her answer due to the base's position on the line - a separate distance error not directly tied to the primary misconception about flipping.",
