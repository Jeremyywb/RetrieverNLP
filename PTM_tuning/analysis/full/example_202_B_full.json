  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(2 \\frac{1}{5} + 1 \\frac{2}{5} = (2+1) + \\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 3 \\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nStudent's incorrect steps:  \n1. Converted \\(2 \\frac{1}{5}\\) to \\(\\frac{11}{5}\\) and \\(1 \\frac{2}{5}\\) to \\(\\frac{7}{5}\\) correctly.  \n2. Added numerators: \\(11 + 7 = 18\\), keeping denominator 5: \\(\\frac{18}{5}\\).  \n3. Failed to convert \\(\\frac{18}{5}\\) back to a mixed number.  \n\nThe error stems from treating the improper fraction \\(\\frac{18}{5}\\) as the final answer despite explicit instructions to present it as a mixed number. The student correctly performed fraction addition but misunderstood the requirement to express the result in the specified format. This aligns with \"leaves answer in unsimplified form\" (here, an improper fraction instead of a mixed number), not confusion about fraction addition rules. It differs from other misconceptions like adding denominators or miscalculating conversions, as those errors would produce different incorrect results (e.g., \\(\\frac{13}{5}\\) or \\(3 \\frac{3}{10}\\)).",
