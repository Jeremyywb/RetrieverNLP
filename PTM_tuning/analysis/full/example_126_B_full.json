  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Shaded rectangle width = Total base - Top rectangle width = 13 cm - 6 cm = 7 cm\n2. Shaded rectangle height = Total height - Top rectangle height = 14 cm - 8 cm = 6 cm\n3. Area = 7 cm \u00d7 6 cm = 42 cm\u00b2\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n13 cm (total base) \u00d7 8 cm (top rectangle height) = 104 cm\u00b2\n\nFlawed reasoning:\nThe student incorrectly used the total base length (13 cm) and top rectangle height (8 cm) as dimensions for the shaded section. They failed to recognize that the shaded rectangle's width is not the full 13 cm but the remaining portion after subtracting the top rectangle's width. Similarly, the height of the shaded rectangle requires subtracting the top rectangle's height from the total height. \n\nThis directly stems from assuming all given numerical values must be multiplied together rather than analyzing which dimensions apply to each component. The error is distinct from simply adding instead of subtracting sections, as the student specifically misapplied full lengths to the wrong component rather than miscalculating arithmetic operations.",
