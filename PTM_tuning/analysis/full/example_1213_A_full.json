  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\div 3 = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{15}\\).  \nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 3 = \\frac{6}{5}\\).  \n\nThe student multiplied \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) by \\(3\\) instead of dividing, skipping the reciprocal step entirely. This indicates they treated division as direct multiplication, conflating the two operations. The error aligns with the misconception of multiplying rather than dividing, as no reciprocal was applied to either fraction. This is distinct from inverting the wrong fraction, which would involve taking a reciprocal but applying it incorrectly. The direct substitution of multiplication for division is the core flaw here.",
