  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows that \\( 2 \\) TVs multiplied by \\( 7 \\) households equals \\( 14 \\), representing the total TVs in those households. \n\nThe student likely saw the \\( 14 \\) and reasoned: \\( 14 \\div 7 = 2 \\), interpreting this as the mean for the row. However, this calculation would only be necessary if they mistakenly believed the \\( 14 \\) itself required division by frequency to derive a value, ignoring that \\( 2 \\) TVs per household is already the fixed value for that row. \n\nThe error stems from conflating the role of the \"TVs \\(\\times\\) Frequency\" column. Instead of recognizing it as a component of the total TVs (summed across all rows for the overall mean), the student treated the individual product \\( 14 \\) as a standalone mean. This directly misapplies how frequency tables aggregate data for averages. \n\nThe misconception differs from confusing columns (e.g., swapping TVs and frequency) or miscomputing totals, as the student correctly multiplied values but misinterpreted the product's purpose in the averaging process. They isolated the row's product as a \"mean\" rather than part of the collective total.",
