  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Identify first significant figure (4 in 400099)\n2. Look at next digit (0) to determine rounding\n3. Since 0 < 5, keep 4 unchanged\n4. Replace all subsequent digits with zeros \u2192 400000\n\nStudent's incorrect steps:\n1. Correctly identified first significant figure (4)\n2. Incorrectly considered trailing digits (99) instead of immediate next digit (0)\n3. Rounded 99 to 100 due to 9 \u2265 5\n4. Produced 400100 instead of 400000\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student treated the trailing 99 as the critical digits for rounding rather than the single digit immediately following the first significant figure. This caused them to erroneously round the number at the tens/units place instead of applying the 1sf rule that only examines the second digit (0 in this case). \n\nThe error stems from misidentifying which digit controls the rounding decision, not from general rounding inaccuracies or confusion about place value hierarchy. This distinguishes it from related misconceptions like handling 9 carryovers or rounding to multiple significant figures. The student prioritized irrelevant trailing digits over the required single-digit check after the first significant figure.",
