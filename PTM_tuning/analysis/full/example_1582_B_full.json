  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{9 \\times 5} = \\frac{1}{45}\\)\n\nStudent's calculation: \\(\\frac{1+1}{9+5} = \\frac{2}{14}\\)\n\nThe student added numerators (1+1) and denominators (9+5) instead of multiplying them. This reflects a fundamental confusion where the operation for fraction multiplication was replaced with addition for both components. The error directly stems from treating multiplication as requiring pairwise addition of corresponding parts rather than applying separate multiplication to numerators and denominators.\n\nThis differs from the misconception of multiplying numerators while adding denominators (which would yield \\(\\frac{1}{14}\\)) or solely misapplying addition rules with common denominators. The error uniquely demonstrates a complete substitution of addition for multiplication in both numerator and denominator operations.",
