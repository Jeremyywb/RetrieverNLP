  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(12 \\div 2 = 6\\), then \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\), resulting in \\(6 + 2 = 8\\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\(12 \\div (2 + 1 \\times 2)\\). They first computed \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\), added \\(2 + 2 = 4\\), then divided \\(12 \\div 4 = 3\\).\n\nThe error stems from treating the entire expression after the division symbol as a single unit. The student incorrectly grouped \\(2 + 1 \\times 2\\) as the divisor, violating the left-to-right precedence of division and multiplication over addition. This reflects a belief that division inherently applies to all subsequent terms rather than only the immediate operand.\n\nThis aligns with the misconception of dividing all numbers after the division symbol without respecting operator hierarchy, not merely left-to-right execution. It differs from left-to-right prioritization (which would yield \\(14\\)) or addition-before-multiplication errors (unrelated here, as multiplication was correctly prioritized over addition in their calculation).\n\nThe flaw specifically involves misinterpreting division's scope rather than general order confusion or addition/multiplication misordering.",
