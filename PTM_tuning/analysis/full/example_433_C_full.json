  "explanation": "The correct answer identifies both the data collection method (primary) and type (qualitative). The question asks for descriptive feelings, yielding non-numerical responses, which defines qualitative data. \n\nThe student's answer (\"Attribute data\") partially recognizes the categorical nature of responses but mislabels the data type. Attribute data is a subset of qualitative data referring specifically to categorical classifications (e.g., labels or groups). However, the broader term \"qualitative\" applies here, as the question collects open-ended descriptions rather than predefined categories. \n\nThe error stems from conflating a specific subtype (attribute/categorical) with the general qualitative classification. This reflects a terminology mismatch rather than confusing quantitative/qualitative (since numerical data isn't involved) or primary/secondary collection methods. The student focused on the categorical aspect but used narrower terminology than required.",
