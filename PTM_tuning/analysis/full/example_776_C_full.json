  "explanation": "Correct calculation: With 9 dashes, there are 8 equal intervals between 0 and 2. Each interval is \\( \\frac{2}{8} = 0.25 \\). The 8th dash is \\( 0 + 7 \\times 0.25 = 1.75 \\).\n\nStudent's error: The student likely calculated \\( 2 - 0.1 = 1.9 \\), assuming the last dash (9th) is 2.0 and the previous dash (8th) is 0.1 less. This assumes intervals of 0.1 instead of 0.25.\n\nReasoning flaw: The student misread the scale by incorrectly dividing the total range (2) into 20 parts (0.1 each) rather than 8 parts (0.25 each). This led them to subtract 0.1 from 2.0 for the 8th dash, ignoring the actual interval size derived from the number of dashes.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: Unlike miscounting dashes or misplacing midpoints, the error stems from an entirely incorrect interval size (0.1 vs. 0.25), indicating a fundamental misreading of the scale's granularity.",
