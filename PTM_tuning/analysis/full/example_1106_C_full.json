  "explanation": "The correct trigonometric ratio for tangent is \\(\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{Opposite}}{\\text{Adjacent}}\\). The problem's given ratio \\(\\frac{\\text{Hypotenuse}}{\\text{Opposite}}\\) corresponds to \\(\\csc(\\theta)\\), not a standard option. \n\nThe student incorrectly associated this ratio with \\(\\tan(\\theta)\\). Their error stems from reversing the required components of the tangent ratio while also misassigning the hypotenuse as the adjacent side. By conflating the hypotenuse with the adjacent side, they transformed the ratio into \\(\\frac{\\text{(Misidentified Adjacent)}}{\\text{Opposite}}\\), which they erroneously equated to \\(\\tan(\\theta)\\) due to inverting the proper numerator/denominator order for tangent. \n\nThis differs from simply confusing sine/cosine for tangent, as the error specifically involves both incorrect side labeling and ratio inversion. The core flaw is the reversal of the tangent ratio's structure, exacerbated by misidentifying the hypotenuse's role, rather than merely selecting the wrong function type.",
