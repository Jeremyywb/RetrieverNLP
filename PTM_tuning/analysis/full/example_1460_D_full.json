  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 650 \\div 100 = 6.5 \\) (since 1 litre = 100 centilitres)\nStudent's calculation: \\( 650 \\div 10 = 65 \\)\n\nThe student incorrectly divided by 10 instead of 100 when converting to litres. This occurred because they treated centilitres as one decimal place smaller than litres (factor of 10) rather than two (factor of 100). Their error stems from misapplying the metric prefix relationship: \"centi-\" means \\( 10^{-2} \\), but they treated it as \\( 10^{-1} \\).\n\nThis aligns with dividing by an incorrect factor of 10 for unit conversion, not confusion between cl/ml (which would involve incorrect magnitude comparisons) or adding zeros (which preserves digit positions differently). The error specifically reflects a miscalculation of the required scaling factor for the unit prefix.",
