  "explanation": "The correct calculation adds numerators: \\(\\frac{4}{11} + \\frac{7}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1\\).  \nThe student correctly summed the fractions to \\(\\frac{11}{11}\\) but failed to recognize that \\(\\frac{11}{11}\\) equals \\(1\\).  \nThe error stems from not interpreting \\(\\frac{n}{n}\\) as equivalent to \\(1\\), despite correctly performing the addition.  \nThis reflects a gap in understanding that fractions with equal numerator and denominator represent whole numbers, not merely \"unsimplified\" fractions.  \nThe error is distinct from partial simplification (e.g., reducing \\(\\frac{2}{4}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) or omitting steps entirely, as the student explicitly wrote \\(\\frac{11}{11}\\) without connecting it to its whole-number equivalent.",
