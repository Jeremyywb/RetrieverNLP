  "explanation": "The correct calculation multiplies the outcomes from both spinners: 4 outcomes \u00d7 5 outcomes = 20 possible pairs.\n\nThe student likely calculated only the outcomes from the 5-section spinner, resulting in 5. \n\nThe error occurred because the student counted outcomes from a single spinner rather than recognizing that each outcome from the 4-section spinner must pair with all outcomes from the 5-section spinner. \n\nThis directly stems from treating the two spinners as isolated events instead of interdependent ones requiring combinatorial multiplication. The misconception is specific to neglecting one spinner's contribution entirely (not merely miscounting within a single spinner). \n\nIt differs from \"fails to consider all possible outcomes\" because the student systematically omitted all outcomes from one spinner rather than partially missing some pairs.",
