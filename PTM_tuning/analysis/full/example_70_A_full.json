  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 630 \\times 0.84 = 529.2 \\).\n\nIncorrect calculation: \\( 630 \\div 0.84 = 750 \\).\n\nThe student treated 630 as the result of 84% of an unknown total, rather than the total itself. This caused them to reverse the relationship between percentage and base value, using division instead of multiplication. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting which quantity the percentage applies to: they assumed 630 was the percentage outcome (e.g., \"84% of X = 630\") instead of recognizing 630 as the original amount from which a percentage should be taken. \n\nThis aligns with the misconception of finding the total when given a percentage, distinct from errors like adding percentages or miscalculating multiplicative steps. The student's answer matches exactly the result of calculating the total from a percentage part, not the part from the total.",
