  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \n0.15 (2 decimal places) \u00d7 0.2 (1 decimal place) = (15 \u00d7 2) \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 = 30 \u00d7 0.001 = 0.03\n\nStudent's likely steps: \n1. Calculated 15 \u00d7 2 = 30 \n2. Incorrectly placed the decimal by moving only 1 place (from 0.2's single decimal) \u2192 30 \u2192 3.0 = 3\n\nCritical flaw: \nThe student treated the decimal places additively (1 instead of 3) rather than cumulatively. This stems from misunderstanding how decimal positions compound during multiplication. By only accounting for one factor's decimal places, they failed to scale the product by the required 10\u207b\u00b3.\n\nDistinction from related errors: \nThis isn't about omitting placeholder zeros or digit alignment, but specifically misapplying the rule for total decimal places. The error occurs in the scaling phase after multiplication, not during digit-by-digit calculation.\n\nFinal consequence: \nWithout recognizing three decimal places are needed, the student's answer became 100\u00d7 too large (3 vs 0.03).",
