  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 130\\% \\times 40 = 1.3 \\times 40 = 52 \\)\n\nIncorrect reasoning: The student concluded percentages >100% are invalid without calculation.\n\nFlaw explanation: The student interpreted percentages strictly as proportions of a whole (\u2264100%), failing to recognize they can represent multiplicative scaling. This caused them to reject the problem's premise rather than calculate \\( 1.3 \\times 40 \\).\n\nDistinction from related errors: This differs from calculation errors (like forgetting to add 100%) because the student didn't attempt the arithmetic - they dismissed the entire concept of percentages >100% as invalid. The error stems from misunderstanding percentage ranges, not computational mistakes.\n\nThe misconception directly prevented engagement with the mathematical operation, making it more fundamental than errors in specific calculation steps.",
