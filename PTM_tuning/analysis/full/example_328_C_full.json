  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Convert \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) to \\(\\frac{3}{9}\\) (equivalent fraction)\n2. Add numerators: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n3. Result: \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\)\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n1. Incorrectly converted \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) (changed denominator but not numerator)\n2. Added numerators: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n3. Result: \\(\\frac{3}{9}\\)\n\nThe student recognized the need for a common denominator (9) but failed to multiply the numerator of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) by 3 when converting it to \\(\\frac{3}{9}\\). This caused them to treat \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) during addition, leading to the incorrect numerator sum. The error specifically stems from altering the denominator without correspondingly adjusting the numerator, distinct from broader misunderstandings about equivalence. Related misconceptions like \"leaving numerators the same after finding a common denominator\" are less precise, as the student attempted conversion but misapplied the scaling factor.",
