  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( x y + 3 b \\) (variables ordered conventionally, coefficient before variable)\n\nStudent's error: \\( y x + b 3 \\) preserves the original operand order in both terms\n\nSpecific flaw: The student maintained the literal left-to-right sequence of operands in multiplication without applying algebraic conventions. They treated \\( y \\times x \\) as \\( yx \\) (acceptable but non-standard) and \\( b \\times 3 \\) as \\( b3 \\), failing to place the numerical coefficient first. This stems from not recognizing that standard notation requires coefficients (numbers) to precede variables, even when written in reverse order. \n\nThe error in \\( b3 \\) specifically reveals a lack of awareness about numerical coefficient positioning, distinct from general commutative property misunderstandings (which would also affect variable ordering). Related misconceptions about multiplication symbols or commutativity between variables don't explain the reversal of number/variable order in the second term.",
