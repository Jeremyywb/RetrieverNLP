  "explanation": "The correct final step in drawing an angle is connecting the marked degree measurement to the original line segment's endpoint. The student incorrectly identified \"draw a line segment\" as the last step, which is actually the initial step in angle construction. The error stems from misordering the sequence of steps: the line segment must first exist as a baseline to measure the angle from using a protractor. The student's reasoning reversed the logical progression of angle creation, treating the foundational element (the line segment) as the concluding action. This differs from listed misconceptions about tool usage or measurement confusion, as the error specifically involves procedural sequencing rather than instrument application or scale reading.",
