  "explanation": "The correct calculation identifies the 2 in the thousands place: \\(2 \\times 1000 = 2000\\).  \nThe student likely calculated \\(2 \\times 10{,}000 = 20{,}000\\), treating the 2 as occupying the ten thousands place.  \nThis error stems from misassigning the digit's position: the student counted the 2 as the second digit from the left but incorrectly associated that position with ten thousands instead of thousands.  \nThe misconception directly conflates the ten thousands and thousands place labels, causing the digit's value to be inflated by a factor of 10.  \nThis differs from zero-related misunderstandings, as the zeros in the number do not influence the misplacement of the 2.  \nThe error is specific to misaligning place value names with their positional order in a 5-digit number.",
