  "explanation": "Correct estimation rounds each number to one significant figure:  \n4.12 \u2192 4, 18.3 \u2192 20, 0.226 \u2192 0.2.  \nCalculation: \\(\\frac{4 \\times 20}{0.2} = \\frac{80}{0.2} = 400\\).  \n\nThe student likely rounded 18.3 to 18 (nearest integer) instead of 20 (1 sf), while correctly rounding 4.12 to 4 and 0.226 to 0.2.  \nThis produced: \\(\\frac{4 \\times 18}{0.2} = \\frac{72}{0.2} = 360\\).  \n\nThe error stems from treating 18.3 as a whole number (18) rather than rounding it to one significant figure (20). The misconception of rounding to integers instead of significant figures directly altered the numerator's magnitude, reducing the final result.  \n\nThis differs from \"rounds to 2 sf\" because 18 is a 2-sf value, but here the student's error was prioritizing integer rounding over 1-sf approximation. Other listed misconceptions (e.g., rounding all down) do not align, as 0.226 was rounded up to 0.2.",
