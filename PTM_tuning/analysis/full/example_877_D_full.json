  "explanation": "Correct approach:\n1. Recognize \"miles\" is a standard unit of length\n2. Understand \"m l\" (milliliters) measures volume\n3. Conclude only Tom's answer relates to length measurement\n\nStudent's error path:\n1. Incorrectly rejected both answers:\n   - Dismissed miles as a length unit\n   - Correctly dismissed \"m l\" (volume)\n2. Final conclusion: Neither correct\n\nKey flaw: Failure to identify \"miles\" as a valid length unit despite it being a standard measurement. This directly stems from not recognizing fundamental length units, distinct from confusing volume/length (which only applied to Katie's answer). The error specifically shows a gap in basic unit categorization rather than volume-related confusion (which the student handled correctly by rejecting \"m l\").",
