  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n1. x\u2081 = 2.0000\n2. x\u2082 = 5 - 1/2 = 4.5000\n3. x\u2083 = 5 - 1/4.5 \u2248 4.7778\n4. x\u2084 = 5 - 1/4.7778 \u2248 4.7907\n5. x\u2085 = 5 - 1/4.7907 \u2248 4.7913 (stabilizes at 4.79 when rounded to 2 decimals)\n\nStudent's Likely Steps:\n1. Calculated x\u2083 \u2248 4.7778\n2. Rounded 4.7778 to 4.78 (correctly rounded)\n3. Stopped at x\u2083, assuming convergence\n\nKey Flaw:\nThe student failed to recognize that iterations must continue until consecutive terms agree to the required precision. While 4.7778 rounds to 4.78, the sequence had not yet stabilized (x\u2084 = 4.7907 differs in the second decimal). The error stems from conflating a single iteration's rounded value with the final converged solution.\n\nDistinction:\nThis is not a rounding rule error (4.7778 correctly rounds to 4.78), but a premature termination of the iteration process. It differs from truncation or 5-rounding misconceptions, as the rounding itself was applied correctly to an intermediate value.",
