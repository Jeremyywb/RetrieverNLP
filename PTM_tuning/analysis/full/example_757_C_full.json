  "explanation": "The correct solution reverses the function machine's operation: If \u221a(input) = 12, then input = 12\u00b2 = 144.  \nThe student incorrectly calculated \u221a12 \u2248 3.464 instead of reversing the operation.  \nThe error stems from performing the original operation (square root) on the output value rather than applying its inverse (squaring).  \nThis demonstrates a failure to recognize that finding the input requires undoing the machine's function through inverse operations.  \nThe error differs from confusing input/output order (which would involve swapping numbers without operations) or multi-step order reversal (which isn't applicable here as there's only one operation).  \nThe core flaw is specifically using the given operation directionally rather than inversely to solve for the unknown input.",
