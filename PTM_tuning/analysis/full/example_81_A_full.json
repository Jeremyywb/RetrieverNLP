  "explanation": "The correct order compares numbers by their actual numerical value: 3,652 (4 digits) < 605,321 (6 digits) < 650,312 (6 digits) < 3,506,212 (7 digits). The student ordered them as 3,506,212, 3,652, 605,321, 650,312. \n\nThe student treated commas as digit separators rather than place-value markers. When comparing 3,506,212 and 3,652, they compared \"506\" (from 3,506,212) to \"6\" (from 3,652) as standalone values, concluding 506 > 6. This caused them to incorrectly rank 3,506,212 above 3,652. \n\nThis reflects a left-to-right digit comparison without recognizing that \"506\" in 3,506,212 represents 506,000 (making it much larger than 3,652). The error is distinct from merely reversing the order, as the flaw specifically involves misinterpreting place value after the comma. It also differs from pure digit-count reasoning, as the student placed a 4-digit number before two 6-digit numbers.",
