  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Substitute \\( x = 3 \\) into \\( y = \\frac{3}{x} \\) to get \\( y = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\).\n\nStudent's error: Likely substituted \\( x = 3 \\) into \\( \\frac{3}{x} \\), resulting in \\( \\frac{3}{3} \\), but treated the expression as \\( \\frac{3}{\\text{(substituted value)} } = 3 \\) without performing the division.\n\nFlaw: The student replaced the variable \\( x \\) with 3 in the denominator but did not execute the division operation, retaining the numerator's value instead of computing \\( 3 \\div 3 \\).\n\nConnection to misconception: This reflects a failure to apply the division operation after substitution, analogous to substituting variables in multiplicative terms without multiplying. The student treated substitution as mere placement of numbers rather than an operational instruction.\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"number divided by itself equals original number\" (which would require recognizing division but misapplying it) or ignoring the denominator entirely. Here, substitution occurred, but the required division was omitted.",
