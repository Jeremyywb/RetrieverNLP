  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (5 cm \u00d7 3 cm) \u00f7 2 = 7.5 cm\u00b2  \nStudent's calculation: 5 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 2 = 30 cm\u00b2  \n\nThe student correctly multiplied base (5 cm) and height (3 cm) but then multiplied by 2 instead of dividing. This stems from misapplying the formula's division step as multiplication. The error directly matches reversing the required operation after multiplying base and height.  \n\nThis differs from simply forgetting to divide (which would yield 15 cm\u00b2) or misordering operations. The specific reversal of division to multiplication explains why the result is double the correct value rather than undivided or partially computed.",
