  "explanation": "Correct solution: If \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of \\(x = 27\\), then \\(x = 27 \\times 3 = 81\\). The operation reverses the fraction's division.\n\nStudent's error: \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\). They treated 27 as the whole amount rather than the fractional part. \n\nFlawed reasoning: The student likely interpreted the equation as \"find \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of 27\" instead of \"27 is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of what number.\" This reflects confusion about whether the given value represents the part or the whole. \n\nConnection to misconception: The error stems from misapplying fraction relationships, specifically failing to recognize that 27 corresponds to the portion being divided, requiring multiplication to restore the whole. \n\nDistinction: While related to operation reversal (division vs multiplication), this error specifically arises from misidentifying the quantities' roles in the part-whole relationship, not just mechanical operation confusion.",
