  "explanation": "The correct probability calculation recognizes replacement maintains the original counts: \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\) yellow balls remain for the second pick. \n\nThe student likely subtracted 1 from both the numerator and denominator after the first pick, computing \\( \\frac{3-1}{7-1} = \\frac{2}{6} \\). \n\nThis error stems from assuming the second pick's probability always reduces by 1 in numerator/denominator, even when replacement occurs. Specifically, the student treated the second event as dependent (without replacement) despite the problem explicitly stating replacement. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of universally reducing counts by 1 for sequential picks, ignoring replacement's effect. It is distinct from errors like using an incorrect denominator for independent events, as the student's error specifically involves misapplying subtraction to counts instead of recognizing replacement preserves them.",
