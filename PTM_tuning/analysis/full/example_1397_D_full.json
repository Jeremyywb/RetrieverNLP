  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 0.4 \\times 5 = 2 \\).  \nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\( 0.4 \\times 5 \\) becomes \"0.4\" and \"5\" combined as 0.45.  \n\nThe student treated the multiplication operator as a directive to concatenate digits rather than scale 0.4 by 5. They preserved the decimal structure of 0.4 and appended the 5 to the hundredths place, resulting in 0.45. This reflects a misinterpretation of the multiplication symbol as a positional digit combiner, not an arithmetic operation.  \n\nThis differs from \"adds instead of multiplies\" because addition would yield \\( 0.4 + 5 = 5.4 \\), not 0.45. The error is uniquely tied to digit placement, not confusion between addition and multiplication.",
