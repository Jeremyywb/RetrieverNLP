  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The distance equals the area under the speed-time graph, which consists of two triangles. Each triangle has base 2 seconds and height \\( v \\). Total area = \\( 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\, \\text{sec} \\times v = 2v \\, \\text{(mph\u00b7sec)} \\). Converting seconds to hours: \\( 2v \\times \\frac{1}{3600} \\, \\text{hours} = \\frac{v}{1800} \\, \\text{miles} \\). Setting \\( \\frac{v}{1800} = 50 \\), solving \\( v = 25 \\, \\text{mph} \\).\n\nStudent's error: They likely calculated \\( \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{total time}} = \\frac{50 \\, \\text{miles}}{4 \\, \\text{sec}} = 12.5 \\, \\text{miles/sec} \\), then incorrectly converted to mph without addressing unit consistency: \\( 12.5 \\times 3600 = 45,\\!000 \\, \\text{mph} \\). However, this does not yield 100. A more plausible error is misapplying the graph\u2019s gradient (acceleration) as speed. The first segment\u2019s gradient is \\( \\frac{v}{2 \\, \\text{sec}} \\). If equated to speed \\( v \\), solving \\( \\frac{v}{2} = 50 \\) gives \\( v = 100 \\).\n\nReasoning flaw: The student conflated the graph\u2019s gradient (acceleration) with speed itself, ignoring that distance requires calculating the area. This directly stems from misinterpreting the graphical representation of speed over time.\n\nDistinction: This is not a scale-reading error (axes are labeled correctly) or area-shape oversight (triangles were recognized). The core issue was attributing physical meaning to the gradient instead of the area.",
