  "explanation": "Correct Calculation: Months with average temperature <25\u00b0C are January (18), February (20), March (21), April (22), May (23), October (22), November (20), December (18) \u2192 8 months.\n\nStudent's Error: The student counted only July (29), August (32), and September (27) \u2192 3 months.\n\nFlaw Explanation: The student inverted the inequality direction, counting temperatures **above** 25\u00b0C instead of below. This directly maps to mixing up \"greater than\" and \"less than\" comparisons. \n\nThe error isn't misreading the scale (temperatures are correctly identified as 29/32/27 for summer months) or misunderstanding the question's intent (they actively counted data points). The mistake specifically stems from interpreting \"below\" as \"above,\" swapping the inequality condition.\n\nDistinction: Unlike inclusion errors (e.g., miscounting June's 25\u00b0C), this error shows a reversed comparison logic, not a threshold ambiguity.",
