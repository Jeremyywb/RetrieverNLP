  "explanation": "Correct calculation through iterations would show convergence approaching 0.8255 after several steps. Rounding 0.8255 to three decimal places requires looking at the fourth decimal (5), which should round up the third decimal from 5 to 6, yielding 0.826.\n\nThe student's answer of 0.825 indicates they either truncated the value after three decimals or rounded down upon encountering a 5 in the fourth decimal. For example, if the calculated value was 0.8255, truncating would directly produce 0.825, while proper rounding would increment the third decimal to 6.\n\nThe error stems from applying truncation or misapplying rounding rules when the discarded digit is exactly 5. The student likely treated the 5 as a signal to keep the third decimal unchanged (e.g., interpreting \"5 or below rounds down\" incorrectly), rather than following the standard convention of rounding up. This matches the primary misconception of rounding down instead of up when the next digit is 5.\n\nThis differs from general truncation errors because the student's answer specifically fails to increment at a 5 boundary, not merely cutting off digits indiscriminately. It also isn't a case of rounding to fewer decimals, as the answer maintains three decimal places.",
