  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 0.5 \\div 2 = 0.25 \\). This requires recognizing division as splitting into equal parts, where \\( 0.5 \\) partitioned into 2 groups yields \\( 0.25 \\) per group.\n\nStudent's likely error: They computed \\( 0.5 \\times 2 = 1 \\), reversing the operation. The misconception stems from conflating division with multiplication when handling fractional quantities. Specifically, they interpreted \"divided by 2\" as needing to multiply to \"balance\" the decimal, rather than splitting the value.\n\nThis aligns with misapplying multiplication for division when given a total to partition. The error differs from subtracting (which would yield negative values) or decimal placement issues (which preserve division but mishandle digit alignment). The result \\( 1 \\) directly reflects an inverted operation, not a procedural misstep in decimal handling or magnitude expectations.",
