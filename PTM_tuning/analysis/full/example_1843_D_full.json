  "explanation": "The gradient of a speed-time graph directly represents acceleration (\u0394s/\u0394t). The negative slope's gradient (-0.8) indicates deceleration: -0.8 m/s\u00b2. \n\nThe student treated the gradient's absolute value (0.8) as acceleration magnitude but ignored its negative sign. This conflates scalar magnitude with vector direction, incorrectly labeling deceleration as acceleration. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the acceleration formula by omitting directional information encoded in the slope's sign. This matches the misconception that acceleration is purely a magnitude-based value rather than a directional quantity. \n\nIt differs from the distance-time graph misconception because the student correctly linked the gradient to acceleration (appropriate for speed-time graphs) but failed to interpret the negative sign as directional deceleration.",
