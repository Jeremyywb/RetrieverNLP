  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows P(P) = 1/26 and P(vowel) = 5/26. Since no letter is both P and a vowel, P(P AND vowel) = 0, confirming mutual exclusivity. \n\nThe student incorrectly assumed independence, likely reasoning that P(P) and P(vowel) don't influence each other. However, mutual exclusivity creates dependence: knowing one occurs eliminates the possibility of the other. \n\nThe flaw stems from treating non-overlapping events as probabilistically independent rather than recognizing that zero intersection forces dependence. This differs from \"multiplies probabilities when independent\" because the error occurred at the conceptual classification stage, not during numerical calculation. \n\nThe student focused on separate occurrence probabilities rather than their joint impossibility, confusing independence (about probability preservation) with exclusivity (about physical impossibility).",
