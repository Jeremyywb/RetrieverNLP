  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires dividing kilograms by 1000 to convert to tonnes: \\(3000 \\div 1000 = 3\\).  \nThe student likely performed \\(3000 \\div 100 = 30\\), using an incorrect divisor.  \nThis error stems from applying a conversion factor of 100 instead of 1000, mistaking the relationship between kilograms and tonnes.  \nThe misconception directly caused the error by substituting the correct metric prefix multiplier (kilo- = 1000) with a decimal-based 100.  \nThis differs from dividing by 10 (which would yield 300) or general confusion about division direction, as the operation itself (division) was appropriate but the factor was wrong.  \nThe error specifically reflects a flawed understanding of tonne's definition as 1000 kg, not a misapplication of division itself.",
