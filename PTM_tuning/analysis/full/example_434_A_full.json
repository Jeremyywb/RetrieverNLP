  "explanation": "To complete the square for \\( m^2 + 6m + 1 \\), the correct step is to take half of 6 (the coefficient of \\( m \\)), yielding \\( 3 \\), and write \\( (m + 3)^2 - 9 + 1 \\). The student incorrectly used \\( \\bigstar = +6 \\), directly inserting the original coefficient of \\( m \\) into the squared term without halving it. This error stems from misapplying the completing-the-square process, specifically skipping the division of the linear coefficient by 2 before squaring. The misconception caused the student to treat \\( (m + 6)^2 \\) as equivalent to \\( m^2 + 6m \\), ignoring the required \\( 2a \\) relationship between the binomial term and the linear coefficient. This differs from factoring-related errors (e.g., confusing products/sums of constants) because the mistake occurs in the algebraic manipulation specific to completing the square, not in factoring strategies.",
