  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(609 \\div 1000 = 609.0 \\rightarrow\\) shift decimal left 3 places \\(= 0.609\\)\n\nStudent's error: Maintained \"609\" as whole-number portion, added three decimal zeros: \\(609.000\\)\n\nFlawed reasoning: The student treated division by 1000 as requiring three decimal zeros instead of recognizing it requires three leftward decimal shifts. This preserved the original digits' place values (hundreds/tens/ones) while incorrectly adding trailing zeros, maintaining the number's magnitude instead of reducing it.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error stems from misunderstanding decimal movement as zero-addition in division. This conflates division's decimal-shifting effect with superficial zero placement, unlike related multiplication errors (which would grow the number) or total operation neglect.\n\nDistinction: Unlike thinking \"division has no effect\" (which would leave 609 unchanged), the student altered the number format while preserving value through misplaced zeros - a specific decimal placement error.",
