  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses the pork sector's angle (40\u00b0) divided by the full circle (360\u00b0) to determine the proportion, then multiplies by the total guests: \\(\\frac{40}{360} \\times 540\\). \n\nThe student likely recognized the pie chart's angles (40\u00b0, 150\u00b0, 80\u00b0, and a square symbol for vegetarian) but fixated on the vegetarian sector's label (a square right angle symbol, 90\u00b0) instead of interpreting it as part of the total 360\u00b0. They might have assumed the square symbol indicated missing numerical data or ambiguity, despite all angles being implicitly defined. \n\nThis error stems from treating the right angle symbol as non-numeric information requiring clarification, rather than recognizing it as a standard 90\u00b0 angle. The student overestimated the need for explicit numerical labels, failing to connect the geometric representation to proportional reasoning. \n\nThis distinguishes from the related misconception about scaling proportions, as the student\u2019s error specifically involves misinterpreting the chart\u2019s visual cues, not the mathematical relationship between angles and total frequency. They correctly identified angles for other sectors but perceived a nonexistent gap in information for the vegetarian portion, invalidating the entire calculation.",
