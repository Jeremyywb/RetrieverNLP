  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows \\( y = \\frac{1}{0} \\), which is undefined because division by zero is mathematically impossible. The student incorrectly substituted \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation and concluded \\( y = 0 \\), treating \\( \\frac{1}{0} \\) as a defined operation yielding zero. This stems from misinterpreting division by zero as producing zero rather than recognizing it as undefined. The error directly reflects confusion between numerical results (like zero) and undefined operations, not a misunderstanding of reciprocal relationships (e.g., believing \\( \\frac{1}{x} = x \\)). While related misconceptions involve reciprocal interpretation, this specific error hinges on conflating an undefined case with a valid numerical output.",
