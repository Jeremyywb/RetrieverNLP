  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n2 + 35 = 37 (whole numbers)\n0.7 + 0.9 = 1.6 (decimal parts)\n37 + 1.6 = 38.6 (combining results)\n\nStudent's calculation:\n2 + 35 = 37\n0.7 + 0.9 = 1.6\n37 + 1.6 = 37.16\n\nThe error occurs when combining 37 and 1.6. The student treated \"1.6\" as two separate digits to append to 37's decimal places rather than a single value to add. Instead of recognizing that 1.6 represents 1 whole + 0.6 tenths (requiring 37 + 1 = 38, then 38 + 0.6), they incorrectly placed both \"1\" and \"6\" in the tenths and hundredths places. This reflects a failure to maintain place value when adding mixed numbers - the \"1\" in 1.6 should modify the whole number column, not occupy the tenths place. This matches the primary misconception of not carrying across decimal points correctly, distinct from errors like misaligning decimal points or miscalculating sums within columns.",
