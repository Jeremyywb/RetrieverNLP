  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\((-7) \\times (-2) = 14\\) (two negatives yield a positive product).\nStudent's calculation: \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\).\n\nThe student computed \\(7 \\times 2\\) instead of \\((-7) \\times (-2)\\), omitting both negative signs entirely. This indicates they treated the negatives as nonexistent rather than applying the rule for multiplying negatives. Their reasoning flaw was disregarding the role of negative signs in the original problem, focusing solely on absolute values. This directly aligns with ignoring negative signs during multiplication, not merely misapplying sign rules or assuming the result must be negative. Unlike misconceptions about mandatory negative results, the error stems from a complete omission of sign considerations.",
