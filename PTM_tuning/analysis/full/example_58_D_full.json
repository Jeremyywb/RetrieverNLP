  "explanation": "The correct representation of \\( x > -1 \\) uses an open circle at \\(-1\\) with a rightward arrow to indicate all values greater than \\(-1\\), excluding \\(-1\\) itself. The student's answer incorrectly used a filled circle at \\(-1\\) while still pointing right. The error stems from misinterpreting the inequality symbol \\( > \\) as including the endpoint \\(-1\\), conflating strict inequalities (\\(>\\)) with inclusive ones (\\(\\geq\\)). This directly corresponds to a misunderstanding of how inequality symbols dictate endpoint inclusion, rather than confusion about symbol direction (e.g., mixing up \\(>\\) and \\(<\\)). The rightward arrow confirms they correctly identified the inequality's direction, ruling out symbol reversal misconceptions. The filled circle specifically demonstrates an incorrect inclusion of \\(-1\\), aligning with the primary misconception about endpoint treatment in inequalities.",
