  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n4 shelves \u00d7 15 plates = 60  \n2 shelves \u00d7 23 plates = 46  \n2 shelves \u00d7 17 plates = 34  \nTotal = 60 + 46 + 34 = 140\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n15 + 23 + 17 = 55\n\nThe student added the plate quantities per shelf (15, 23, 17) directly without multiplying each by their respective shelf counts. This shows they treated shelf quantities as individual values to sum rather than repeated groups requiring multiplication. The error stems from conflating additive combination of distinct values with multiplicative grouping needed for repeated quantities. This matches \"adds instead of multiplies\" rather than other listed misconceptions, as they included all data points but failed to apply scaling operations appropriately.",
