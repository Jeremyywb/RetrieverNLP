  "explanation": "Correct comparison requires evaluating each fraction's value:\n\\( \\frac{1}{12} = 0.083 \\), \\( \\frac{2}{6} = 0.333 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\), \\( \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \\).\n\nThe student reversed the order entirely, listing:\n\\( \\frac{3}{4} > \\frac{1}{2} > \\frac{2}{6} > \\frac{1}{12} \\).\n\nThe error stems from treating denominators as the sole determinant of size, but misapplying their relationship to value. The student incorrectly associated larger denominators with smaller fractions, then sorted fractions in descending denominator order (12 > 6 > 4 > 2) rather than ascending value. However, they inverted the required direction: instead of ordering smallest denominators (largest values) first, they listed largest values first due to misinterpreting how denominator size translates to fraction magnitude.\n\nThis aligns with the misconception that denominators alone dictate size, but distinguishes from not finding common denominators (all fractions were compared relatively) or swapping specific pairs (the entire sequence was reversed).",
