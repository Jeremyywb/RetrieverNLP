  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires finding the smallest number divisible by both 6 and 7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, LCM(6,7)=6\u00d77=42. \n\nThe student likely added 6+7=13, treating the LCM as a sum rather than a product. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying addition when multiplication is required for finding common multiples. The student confused the arithmetic operation needed to generate multiples (which inherently involve multiplication) with direct summation of the original numbers. \n\nThis aligns with interpreting \"lowest common multiple\" as combining the numbers through addition instead of identifying their shared multiplicative product. \n\nThe error is distinct from general misunderstandings of \"multiple\" or confusing sums with products in other contexts, as the numerical result directly matches 6+7 rather than alternative operations.",
