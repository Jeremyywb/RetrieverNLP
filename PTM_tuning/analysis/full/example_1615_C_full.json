  "explanation": "The correct equation \\(\\frac{n-6}{3}=21\\) directly reflects the sequence: subtract 6 first (inside parentheses), then divide by 3. The student wrote \\(3(n-6)=21\\), reversing the division operation into multiplication. \n\nThe error stems from misapplying the inverse operation prematurely. The phrase \"divide the result by three\" requires division by 3 in the equation. However, the student incorrectly substituted division with multiplication by 3, likely conflating the equation setup with the solving step (where multiplying by 3 would later reverse the division). \n\nThis differs from order-of-operations errors, as the subtraction was correctly prioritized. The flaw specifically involves translating \"divide by 3\" as \\(\\times 3\\) rather than \\(\\div 3\\), directly linking to misinterpreting inverse operations during equation formation.",
