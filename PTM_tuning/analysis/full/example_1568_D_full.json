  "explanation": "Correct calculation: (2 + 0.2 + 0.02) \u00f7 3 = 2.22 \u00f7 3 = 0.74  \nStudent's likely calculation: Selected 0.2 as the middle number in the ordered list [0.02, 0.2, 2]  \n\nThe student treated the middle value (median) as the mean, skipping the summation and division steps entirely. This occurred because they conflated the statistical definitions, assuming central tendency requires only identifying a positional midpoint rather than averaging. The misconception directly maps to interpreting \"mean\" as synonymous with \"median,\" as evidenced by their answer matching the exact median value.  \n\nThis differs from related errors like omitting division (which would yield 2.22) or misdividing (e.g., 1 \u00f7 3 \u2248 0.33). The error is uniquely tied to substituting median for mean, not miscalculating the average itself.",
