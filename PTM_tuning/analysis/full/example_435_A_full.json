  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n\\(-28 - (-4) \\times 2 = -28 - (-8) = -20\\)  \nMultiplication performed before subtraction.\n\nStudent's calculation:\n\\(2 \\times (-2) - (-4) \\times 4 \\rightarrow -4 - (+16) = -20\\)  \n(incorrectly resolved as \\(-4 - 16\\) instead of \\(-4 - (-16)\\))\n\nFlawed reasoning:  \nThe student treated the subtraction operator as directly modifying the sign of \\(-4\\) *before* performing multiplication. This caused them to compute \\(-(-4) \\times 4\\) as \\(+(4 \\times 4) = 16\\) instead of \\((-4 \\times 4) = -16\\), then subtract this miscomputed value from \\(-4\\). \n\nThis reflects a failure to prioritize multiplication over subtraction. The error aligns with right-to-left execution of operations (resolving \\(-(-4)\\) first) rather than applying multiplication precedence. \n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:  \nThe error isn't due to strict BIDMAS order or sign errors in multiplication, but specifically to misordered operations overriding multiplicative priority.",
