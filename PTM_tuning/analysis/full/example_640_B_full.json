  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(40\\degree + 32\\degree = 72\\degree\\), so \\(k = 180\\degree - 72\\degree = 108\\degree\\).\n\nStudent's error: They likely assumed \\(k = 90\\degree\\) without verifying whether the triangle contained a right angle. \n\nThe flaw stems from treating \\(k\\) as a right angle despite no diagram notation (e.g., square symbol) or problem statement confirming this. This directly aligns with assuming angle measures without justification. \n\nThe error differs from forgetting to subtract from \\(180\\degree\\) (which would leave \\(72\\degree\\)) or misapplying angle facts. The answer \\(90\\degree\\) specifically reflects an unjustified geometric assumption rather than arithmetic oversight.\n\nThis distinction shows the error arises from assuming \\(k\\)'s measure rather than calculating via the triangle sum rule.",
