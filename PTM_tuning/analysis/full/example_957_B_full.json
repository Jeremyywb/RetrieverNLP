  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \nTom's method: \\( \\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)  \nKatie's method: \\( \\frac{15}{18} - \\frac{6}{18} = \\frac{9}{18} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)  \n\nStudent's flawed reasoning:  \nThey likely concluded only Katie's 18-denominator method works because they saw 6 as a denominator for \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) (producing \\( \\frac{2}{6} \\)) as invalid or incomplete.  \n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student failed to recognize that multiplying numerator/denominator by different integers (like \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{2} \\)) preserves equivalence. They incorrectly assumed only larger denominators (18) ensure validity.  \n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis isn't about finding non-LCM multiples (since 18 isn't the LCM) but about rejecting equivalent fractions created through proportional scaling. The student accepted Katie's larger denominator but dismissed Tom's equivalent scaling.  \n\nKey misconception:  \nThe error stems from believing common denominators must be entirely new values rather than adjusted forms of existing denominators, demonstrating a failure to connect equivalent fraction operations across scales.",
