  "explanation": "The correct answer requires recognizing that \"equilateral\" explicitly refers to equality of sides only (e.g., an equilateral triangle is regular, but a rhombus can be equilateral without equal angles). \n\nThe student incorrectly added \"all angles equal\" to the requirements. This stems from conflating \"equilateral\" (side equality) with \"regular polygon\" (both side and angle equality). \n\nThe error occurs at the definition stage: the student treated \"equilateral\" as equivalent to \"regular\" rather than a distinct property. This directly aligns with confusing regular polygon properties (which require both) with specialized terms that describe only one aspect. \n\nThis is distinct from misconceptions about minimum requirements for regularity (e.g., thinking angles alone suffice) because the student added an unnecessary requirement rather than omitting one. The conflation of two distinct geometric terms (\"equilateral\" and \"regular\") is the specific flaw here.",
