  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Given (1/3)A = 12 \u2192 A = 12 \u00d7 3 = 36\n2. Then (1/2)A = 36 \u00f7 2 = 18\n\nStudent's error path:\n1. Treated (1/3)A = 12 as A = 12 \u00f7 3 = 4\n2. Calculated (1/2) of 4 = 2\n\nThe student incorrectly divided 12 by the fraction's denominator (3) instead of multiplying by its reciprocal (3) to find A. This caused them to reduce the value instead of scaling up to the whole quantity. The error directly stems from misapplying division when multiplicative inversion was required. This specific misstep aligns with the listed primary misconception (dividing instead of multiplying), not with fraction-of-fraction errors or incomplete calculations, as the error occurred at the initial problem-solving step.",
