  "explanation": "The correct reflection would mirror each point across the horizontal line, preserving distances perpendicular to the line. For example, a triangle in the upper left would appear in the lower left, equidistant from the line. \n\nThe student's answer likely shows points mirrored horizontally (left/right) rather than vertically (top/bottom). For instance, an upper-left feature might incorrectly appear in the upper right instead of the lower left. \n\nThis stems from misinterpreting the reflection axis: the horizontal line requires vertical inversion (over the x-axis), but the student treated it as requiring horizontal inversion (over the y-axis). \n\nThe error directly connects to confusing the reflection direction relative to the line's orientation. The student applied a horizontal flip (suitable for a vertical line) instead of a vertical flip (needed for a horizontal line). \n\nThis distinguishes from diagonal reflection errors, as the line here is horizontal. It also doesn't involve point-to-line distance miscalculations, since positional misplacement dominates the error pattern.",
