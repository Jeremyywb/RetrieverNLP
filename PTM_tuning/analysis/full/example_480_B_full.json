  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n72,980 + 100 = 73,080  \nAddition requires increasing the hundreds digit (9 \u2192 10), carrying over to make 2 thousands \u2192 3 thousands, resulting in 73,080.\n\nStudent's calculation:\n72,980 + 100 = 73,980  \nThey added 1 to the thousands digit (2 \u2192 3) while leaving the hundreds digit unchanged (9 \u2192 9).\n\nFlawed reasoning:  \nThe student treated the hundreds place as the thousands place, incorrectly modifying the wrong column when adding 100. This stems from misaligning the value of 100 with the thousands column instead of recognizing it affects the hundreds place. \n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nThis isn't a regrouping error (9+1=10 was ignored) but a failure to associate \"100\" with the hundreds column. The error directly stems from place-value misassignment, not forgetting to carry or miscalculating sums.",
