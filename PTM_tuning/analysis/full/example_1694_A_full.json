  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires dividing 330 ml by 1000 (since 1 litre = 1000 ml):  \n330 \u00f7 1000 = 0.33 litres.  \n\nThe student likely calculated 330 \u00f7 100 = 3.3 litres.  \n\nThe error stems from using a divisor of 100 instead of 1000 when converting millilitres to litres. This indicates a misunderstanding of the relationship between metric units, specifically conflating the conversion factor for centi- (100) with milli- (1000).  \n\nThe misconception directly caused the student to reduce the unit size by two decimal places (\u00f7100) rather than three (\u00f71000). This differs from the \"10ml in a litre\" misconception (which would yield 33 litres) and aligns precisely with \"divided by 100 rather than 1000,\" as no decimal-point misplacement (e.g., shifting two places instead of three) needs to be inferred.",
