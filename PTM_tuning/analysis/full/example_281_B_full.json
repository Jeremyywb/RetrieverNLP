  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n\\( x_1 = \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{(0)^3}{9} = \\frac{8}{9} - 0 = \\frac{8}{9} \\)\n\nStudent's likely calculation:\n\\( x_1 = \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{(1)^3}{9} = \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{7}{9} \\)\n\nThe student incorrectly substituted \\( x_0 = 1 \\) instead of the given \\( x_0 = 0 \\). This substitution error directly caused the miscalculation, as they reduced \\( \\frac{8}{9} \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\) instead of keeping it unchanged. The misconception here is strictly about value substitution, not confusion between cubing/squaring or arithmetic errors, since \\( 0^3 \\) unambiguously equals 0 and no complex arithmetic was required. Related misconceptions about exponents or multiplication don't apply because any exponent of 0 would still yield 0.",
