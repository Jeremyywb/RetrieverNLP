  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( u_{11} = 2 - 5(11) = 2 - 55 = -53 \\).\n\nStudent's likely steps: Calculated \\( 5 \\times 11 = 55 \\), then treated \\( 2 - 55 \\) as \\( -(55 + 2) = -57 \\).\n\nThe error occurred because the student incorrectly added the absolute values of 55 and 2 when subtracting \\( 55 \\) from \\( 2 \\), then applied a negative sign to the sum. This reflects a misunderstanding of how to handle \\( a - b \\) when \\( b > a \\), where the correct result is \\( -(b - a) \\), not \\( -(a + b) \\).\n\nThis matches the misconception of adding absolute values and negating when subtracting, even though the problem did not involve subtracting a negative number. The error is distinct from misapplying sign rules in multiplication or miscounting terms, as the sequence formula was directly substituted with \\( n = 11 \\).",
