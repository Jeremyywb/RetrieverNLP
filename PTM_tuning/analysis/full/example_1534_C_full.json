After subtracting 15 from 17 (remainder 2), the student failed to combine the remainder with the last digit (1) to form 21. Instead, they treated the isolated 1 as the number to divide, resulting in 1\u00f73=0. This reflects a failure to properly carry/combine the remainder with subsequent digits during the division process. \n\nThe misconception specifically involves mishandling place value progression in multi-digit division, not merely arithmetic errors or directional mistakes. Related subtraction or right-left errors would produce different digit patterns (e.g., misplaced quotients earlier in the process).",
