  "explanation": "The correct ascending order (deepest first) requires recognizing that -6 < -2.6 < -1.5. The student ordered them as -2.6, -1.5, -6. \n\nThe student likely compared absolute values: 1.5 < 2.6 < 6, then treated these as equivalent to the original negative numbers. This demonstrates a failure to understand that in negative numbers, greater absolute values correspond to smaller values. \n\nThe error stems from directly translating absolute magnitude comparisons to negative numbers without inversion. This matches the misconception that \"negative numbers with larger absolute values are greater,\" as opposed to errors in decimal place value or number line direction. \n\nThe student's sequence (-2.6, -1.5, -6) aligns precisely with ranking absolute values ascendingly, confirming this specific misunderstanding rather than decimal digit comparison or number line orientation errors.",
