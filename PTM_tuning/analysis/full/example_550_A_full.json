  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nTom: \\(3+2-1 = (3+2)-1 = 4\\) and \\(3-1+2 = (3-1)+2 = 4\\) (valid due to left associativity).\nKatie: \\(3+2\u00d71 = 3+(2\u00d71) = 5\\) and \\(2\u00d71+3 = (2\u00d71)+3 = 5\\) (valid due to multiplication first, then addition).\n\nStudent's Incorrect Reasoning:\nThe student likely calculated Katie's equation as \\(3+2\u00d71 = (3+2)\u00d71 = 5\\) and \\(2\u00d71+3 = 2\u00d7(1+3) = 8\\), incorrectly prioritizing addition over multiplication in the second expression.\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nThe student treated addition and multiplication as having equal priority, grouping \\(1+3\\) first in Katie's right-hand side instead of performing multiplication first. This directly caused them to incorrectly conclude Katie's equivalence was invalid.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nUnlike errors involving right-to-left calculation or assuming all operations are commutative, this error specifically shows failure to prioritize multiplication over addition, aligning with the \"Treats all operations equally without regard for PEMDAS/BODMAS\" misconception.",
