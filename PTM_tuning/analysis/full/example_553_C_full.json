  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\div \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{14}{15} \\).\n\nStudent's likely error: They computed \\( \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{14-15}{35} = \\frac{-1}{35} \\), then took the absolute value.\n\nReasoning flaw: The student treated multiplication as addition, requiring subtraction to isolate the unknown. This caused them to incorrectly apply subtraction to numerators/denominators instead of using division for inverse operations.\n\nDistinction: This differs from \"using original operation\" (e.g., multiplying instead of dividing), which would yield \\( \\frac{6}{35} \\). The error specifically stems from misinterpreting the multiplicative relationship as additive.\n\nThe misconception directly caused the error by substituting inverse operations with additive reasoning, conflicting with the problem's multiplicative structure.",
