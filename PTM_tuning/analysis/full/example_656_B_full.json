  "explanation": "To find the first cube number greater than 40, we calculate \\( n^3 \\) sequentially: \\( 3^3 = 27 \\), \\( 4^3 = 64 \\). Since 64 > 40, it is the correct answer. \n\nThe student likely computed \\( 7^2 = 49 \\), treating 7 as the base and 2 as the exponent. This shows they applied squaring (raising to power 2) instead of cubing (raising to power 3). \n\nThe error stems from conflating the operations for square and cube numbers. The student identified the next integer (7) after \\( \\sqrt{40} \\approx 6.3 \\), then squared it, rather than cubing the next integer (4) after \\( \\sqrt[3]{40} \\approx 3.4 \\). \n\nThis aligns with confusing squaring and cubing, not merely general exponent errors, as 49 is explicitly a square number. It differs from adding the index (e.g., \\( 40 + 3 \\)) or misapplying other powers, which would not yield 49.",
