  "explanation": "The correct calculation is \\( \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2 \\) because \\( 2^3 = 8 \\). \n\nThe student likely reasoned: \\( 2^3 = 8 \\), then incorrectly concluded \\( \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2^2 = 4 \\). \n\nThe error stems from conflating the inverse operation (cube root) with squaring the base. Instead of identifying the number that, when cubed, equals 8, the student squared the base (2) after recognizing its relationship to 8. \n\nThis directly aligns with confusing cube rooting with squaring, as the student replaced the required inverse operation (cube root) with an unrelated squaring step. \n\nIt differs from dividing by the root's order (which would yield \\( 8/3 \\)) or misapplying square roots (which would approximate \\( \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.83 \\)). The error specifically substitutes squaring for the inverse of cubing.",
