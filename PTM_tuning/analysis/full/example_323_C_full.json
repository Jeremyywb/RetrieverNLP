  "explanation": "To factorize \\( x^{2}+15x+36 \\), we seek numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( a + b = 15 \\) and \\( a \\times b = 36 \\). The correct pair (3 and 12) satisfies both conditions. \n\nThe student selected 1 and 36, which multiply to 36 but sum to 37. This indicates they prioritized the product matching the constant term (36) but did not verify whether the sum equals the coefficient of \\( x \\) (15). \n\nThe error stems from a failure to enforce both required conditions simultaneously. The student likely identified valid factor pairs of 36 but neglected to check if their sum equals 15, stopping at the first pair that achieved the correct product. \n\nThis distinguishes from the misconception of swapping the roles of sum/product (e.g., thinking the numbers must multiply to 15), as the student correctly associated multiplication with the constant term but omitted the summation requirement for the linear coefficient.",
