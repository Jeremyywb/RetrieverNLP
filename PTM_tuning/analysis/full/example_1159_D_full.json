  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1st term: -3 (given)\n2nd term: (-3)\u00b2 - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5\n3rd term: 5\u00b2 - 4 = 25 - 4 = 21\n\nStudent's calculation:\n1st term: -3\n2nd term: (2nd position number)\u00b2 - 4 = 2\u00b2 - 4 = 0\n3rd term: (3rd position number)\u00b2 - 4 = 3\u00b2 - 4 = 5\n\nThe student incorrectly applied the rule to positional indices instead of the previous term. This caused them to calculate 2\u00b2-4=0 instead of using (-3)\u00b2-4=5 for the second term. The error stems from misinterpreting the term-to-term rule as operating on term positions rather than prior sequence values. This differs from arithmetic sequence confusion, as the student's method actually matches a position-based quadratic pattern (n\u00b2-4), not linear progression. Their calculation shows they understood squaring and subtraction, but misidentified the input for these operations.",
