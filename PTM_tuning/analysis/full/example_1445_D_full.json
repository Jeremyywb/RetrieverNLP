  "explanation": "The correct range is calculated as maximum value minus minimum value: \\(25 - x\\).  \nThe student summed all known values \\(5 + 8 + 19 + 25 = 57\\), added \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then divided by 6: \\(\\frac{57 + x + y}{6}\\).  \n\nThe error stems from treating the range as a mean calculation, requiring division by the number of data points. This conflates the definitions of range (a difference) and mean (a sum divided by count). The variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) were erroneously included in a total sum rather than identifying \\(x\\) as the minimum and \\(25\\) as the maximum.  \n\nThis aligns with confusing the range with the mean, not merely \"adding all numbers\" (which is a step in calculating the mean). Other listed misconceptions (median, even-numbered datasets) are irrelevant here, as the student\u2019s operations explicitly follow mean logic.",
