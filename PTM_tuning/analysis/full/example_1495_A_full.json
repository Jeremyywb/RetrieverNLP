  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Let the star be \\( x \\). The middle left box becomes \\( x + 3g \\), and the middle right box is \\( 3g + 2g = 5g \\). The top box is \\( (x + 3g) + 5g = x + 8g \\). Setting \\( x + 8g = 2f + 8g \\), we find \\( x = 2f \\).\n\nStudent's error: Assuming \\( x = f \\), leading to \\( f + 8g \\) in the top box, which doesn't equal \\( 2f + 8g \\).\n\nReasoning flaw: The student failed to recognize that the star's coefficient directly determines the \\( f \\)-term in the final sum. Since the star is added only once (via the middle left box), its coefficient must match the \\( 2f \\) in the top. The error stems from treating the star's contribution as implicitly doubled, rather than tracking its singular additive role.\n\nDistinction: This isn't a failure to combine like terms (e.g., \\( 3g + 2g \\) was correctly calculated) or commutativity, but a misjudgment of how the star's value propagates through the pyramid's structure. The student incorrectly assumed the star's coefficient equaled the top's \\( f \\)-term without verifying its additive path.",
