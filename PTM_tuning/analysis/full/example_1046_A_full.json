  "explanation": "The correct calculation substitutes \\( x_1=2 \\) into the recurrence relation:  \n\\( x_2 = 5 - \\frac{1}{x_1} = 5 - \\frac{1}{2} = 4.5 \\).  \n\nThe student\u2019s answer matches \\( x_1 \\), indicating they likely concluded \\( x_2 = x_1 \\) without applying the term-to-term rule.  \n\nThe flaw stems from misinterpreting the sequence progression: instead of computing \\( x_{n+1} \\) using the formula, they assumed the sequence remains constant. This directly corresponds to failing to recognize the requirement to apply the recursive operation to advance terms.  \n\nThe error is distinct from selecting a different incorrect term (e.g., \\( x_3 \\)) or misapplying the formula with arithmetic errors. Here, the absence of any calculation step shows a fundamental disconnect with the sequence\u2019s iterative nature.",
