  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Convert 4 cm\u00b2 to mm\u00b2: \\(4 \\times 10^2 = 400\\) mm\u00b2\n2. Add 4 mm\u00b2: \\(400 + 4 = 404\\) mm\u00b2\n\nStudent's error:\n1. Incorrectly converted 4 cm\u00b2 as \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) mm\u00b2\n2. Added 40 + 4 = 44 mm\u00b2\n\nThe student treated the area conversion as linear (10:1) instead of squaring the unit ratio. They multiplied by 10 mm/cm (linear conversion factor) rather than \\(10^2\\) mm\u00b2/cm\u00b2 for area. This directly corresponds to failing to apply the squared relationship between linear and area units. The error differs from \"adding conversion factors\" (which would involve sums) or \"not converting at all\" - here they converted but used the wrong exponent. Their answer demonstrates awareness of unit conversion but miscalculates the dimensionality of area units.",
