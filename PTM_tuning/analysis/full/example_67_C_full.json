  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(\\sqrt{9} = 3\\) because \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n\nIncorrect calculation: Student computed \\(9^2 = 81\\) instead of finding \\(x\\) where \\(x^2 = 9\\).\n\nThe student misinterpreted the square root operation as squaring the original number. They applied the inverse operation incorrectly by treating \\(\\sqrt{9}\\) as an instruction to square 9 rather than find the base that squares to 9. This directly stems from confusing the notation's purpose: square roots identify inputs to squaring operations, not outputs.\n\nThis error is distinct from multiplying by the index (which would yield \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\)) or confusing fourth roots (which would require \\(3^4 = 81\\), not \\(9^2\\)). The core issue was misapplying the operator's directionality, not arithmetic errors with exponents.\n\nThe misconception directly maps to mistaking the square root symbol as a command to perform squaring rather than undoing it.",
