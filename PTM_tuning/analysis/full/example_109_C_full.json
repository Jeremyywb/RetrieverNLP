  "explanation": "The correct reasoning shows that a quadratic's factorability (into rational factors) and x-intercepts (real roots) are related but distinct concepts. A quadratic with no real roots (discriminant < 0) cannot be factored using real linear factors, making Katie correct. However, a quadratic that cannot be factored with rational numbers (e.g., \\(x^2 - 2\\)) might still have real roots (\\( \\pm\\sqrt{2} \\)), disproving Tom's claim.\n\nThe student likely assumed a bidirectional relationship: \"non-factorable \u21e8 no x-intercepts\" and \"no x-intercepts \u21e8 non-factorable.\" While the second implication holds (Katie's correct statement), the first does not. The error stems from conflating algebraic factorability (using integer/rational coefficients) with the existence of real roots. This matches the primary misconception about reasoning errors in quadratic relationships, distinct from confusion about discriminants or quadratic terminology. The student failed to recognize that irrational roots still produce x-intercepts even when rational factorization is impossible.",
