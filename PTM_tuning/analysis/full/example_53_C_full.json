  "explanation": "Correct analysis: A rectangle has both exactly two lines of symmetry (vertical/horizontal midlines) and rotational symmetry of order 2. This places it in region B (intersection).\n\nStudent's error: Placing it in region C (rotational symmetry only) suggests they recognized the rotational symmetry but overlooked the two lines of symmetry.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student likely identified rotational symmetry correctly but incorrectly concluded the rectangle lacks exactly two lines of symmetry. This stems from misapplying symmetry concepts by either (1) not testing for vertical/horizontal midlines or (2) conflating rotational symmetry with the absence of reflection symmetry.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error aligns most closely with the fourth listed misconception (\"Believes lines of symmetry must be vertical or horizontal\") if the student dismissed valid vertical/horizontal midlines due to rectangle proportions, but this is contradicted because those lines are valid. More accurately, the error reflects a failure to systematically check for lines of symmetry, distinct from rotational calculations.\n\nDistinction: This differs from rotational symmetry misconceptions (first three listed), as the student correctly identified order 2 rotational symmetry but erred in reflection symmetry analysis.",
