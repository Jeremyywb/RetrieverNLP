  "explanation": "To solve \\((h-8)(h+3)=0\\) using the zero product property:\n1. \\(h-8=0 \\Rightarrow h=8\\)\n2. \\(h+3=0 \\Rightarrow h=-3\\)\n\nThe student likely set \\(h-8=0\\) but concluded \\(h=-8\\) instead of solving algebraically. They treated the expression \\(h-8\\) as requiring a sign-flip to determine the root (\"if the bracket shows minus, the solution must be negative\"), incorrectly assigning \\(h=-8\\) without performing the actual equation solving step.\n\nThis demonstrates a misapplication of the zero product property where the student conflates the structure of the factor \\((h - k)\\) with an assumed negative root. The error occurs specifically in interpreting the relationship between the factor's constant term and the root's sign, rather than forgetting to swap signs during factorization (a related but distinct error where roots are converted to factors incorrectly). The flaw stems from assuming variables inherit the sign from their position in the bracket without proper equation solving.",
