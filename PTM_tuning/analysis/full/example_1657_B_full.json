  "explanation": "To convert 0.03 to a percentage:  \n**Correct calculation**: \\( 0.03 \\times 100 = 3\\% \\).  \n\n**Student's error**: \\( 0.03 \\times 1000 = 30\\% \\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly multiplied by 1000 instead of 100. This suggests they confused the required scaling factor for percentage conversion, treating it as a thousandfold increase rather than a hundredfold. The error directly aligns with multiplying by 1000, as \\( 0.03 \\times 1000 = 30 \\), matching the incorrect answer.  \n\nThis differs from place-value misconceptions (e.g., misreading 0.03 as 0.3 would yield 30% but involve misinterpreting digit positions) or removing the decimal (which would produce 3%, not 30%). The error is uniquely tied to the incorrect scaling factor applied.",
