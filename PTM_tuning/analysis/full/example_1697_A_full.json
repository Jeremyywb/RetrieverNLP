  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\n- In a descending sequence with difference 17, earlier terms are larger\n- To find the 1st term (star) from the 3rd term (488):\n- Add 17 twice: 488 + 17 = 505 (term 2), then 505 + 17 = 522\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\n- 488 - 17 = 471 (direct subtraction of one difference)\n\nReasoning Flaw:\n- The student treated the descending sequence as requiring subtraction to reach earlier terms\n- This reverses the actual relationship where earlier terms require addition of differences\n- Specifically, they applied the difference in the wrong direction for a single step\n\nMisconception Link:\n- The error stems from incorrect directional application of the constant difference\n- This matches \"Shifts the sequence incorrectly by the constant difference\"\n\nDistinction from Related Errors:\n- Not a term numbering error (they didn't confuse term positions)\n- No multiplication or proportional reasoning was used\n- The core issue is directional misunderstanding of difference application",
