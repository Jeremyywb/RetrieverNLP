  "explanation": "To find the range, one calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This requires identifying these extremes through data ordering, not summation. The student incorrectly identified \"check units\" as unnecessary. However, if the original data has units (e.g., meters), the range inherits those units, making unit verification contextually relevant. The error stems from conflating arithmetic operations (addition) with contextual interpretation (units). The student treated unit-checking as irrelevant to a purely numerical calculation, failing to recognize that units persist through subtraction. This aligns with difficulties in contextual translation, not arithmetic steps like reordering. Related misconceptions about reordering data or misunderstanding the question don't explain why the student specifically targeted unit-checking instead of identifying summation as irrelevant.",
