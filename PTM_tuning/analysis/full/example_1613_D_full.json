  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nFor Tom's equations:\nAdding 4x-3y=12 and x+3y=15 yields (4x+x) + (-3y+3y) = 12+15 \u2192 5x=27 (y eliminated)\nFor Katie's equations:\nAdding 4x+3y=12 and x-3y=15 yields (4x+x) + (3y-3y) = 12+15 \u2192 5x=27 (y eliminated)\n\nStudent's error:\nThe student likely examined both cases and saw coefficients with matching magnitudes but opposite signs. They might have calculated:\nFor Tom: 4x-3y + x+3y = 5x=27 \u2192 correct elimination\nFor Katie: 4x+3y + x-3y = 5x=27 \u2192 correct elimination\nBut rejected both solutions.\n\nReasoning flaw:\nThe student incorrectly assumed equations must be subtracted when coefficients have opposite signs. They believed elimination requires subtraction in such cases, not recognizing that additive combination of equal-magnitude opposites cancels terms regardless of original equation order.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:\nThis differs from thinking same signs require addition (they don't - they require subtraction) or that elimination always uses subtraction. The specific error was applying subtraction to opposite-sign terms instead of recognizing additive elimination works here.",
