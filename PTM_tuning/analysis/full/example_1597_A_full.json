  "explanation": "The correct operation requires using the exponent button \\( x^{\\square} \\) to input a power. The student selected the fraction button \\( \\frac{\\square}{\\square} \\), treating the exponent's position (e.g., \\( x^2 \\)) as equivalent to a fraction's numerator. \n\nThis error stems from misinterpreting the superscript notation for exponents as a numerator in a fractional layout. The student conflated the vertical placement of a fraction's numerator with the horizontal placement of an exponent's value, assuming both require the fraction button. \n\nUnlike reciprocal or subtraction misconceptions, this specific confusion directly ties to misidentifying the symbol's spatial arrangement rather than operational properties (e.g., division vs. exponentiation). The student's reasoning mapped the exponent's \"raised\" position to the fraction's top box, leading to the incorrect button choice.",
