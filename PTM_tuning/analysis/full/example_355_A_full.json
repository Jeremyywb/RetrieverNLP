  "explanation": "The correct answer recognizes that a parallelogram has rotational symmetry of order 2 (matching itself at 180\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 rotations). The student incorrectly selected a trapezium, which typically has no rotational symmetry unless it is isosceles, where it still only has order 1 (symmetry only at 360\u00b0). \n\nThe student likely assumed rotational symmetry exists in trapeziums without verifying their properties. The error stems from not knowing that parallelograms inherently possess 180\u00b0 rotational symmetry, making their order higher than trapeziums. This misconception directly caused the student to overlook the parallelogram's distinct rotational property and default to an incorrect shape. \n\nThe error is distinct from confusing rectangle symmetry (order 2, not 4) or conflating shape names, as the mistake centers on misjudging the parallelogram's rotational characteristics rather than misapplying other properties or terminology.",
