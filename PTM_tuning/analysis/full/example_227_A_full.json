  "explanation": "The inequality \\( d \\leq h \\) holds when \\( d \\) is less than **or equal to** \\( h \\). The pair \\( d=4, h=4 \\) satisfies this because \\( 4 = 4 \\). The student incorrectly rejected this valid pair. \n\nTheir reasoning likely treated \\( \\leq \\) as if it excluded equality, interpreting the symbol strictly as \"less than\" (\\( < \\)) rather than \"less than or equal to.\" This caused them to falsely identify \\( d=4, h=4 \\) as violating the inequality. \n\nThis error aligns with misinterpreting the inclusion of equality in the symbol, distinct from confusing inequality directions (e.g., reversing \\( \\leq \\) to \\( \\geq \\)) or misapplying counter-example selection. The student\u2019s misconception specifically excluded the equality condition inherent to \\( \\leq \\).",
