  "explanation": "The correct translation from (4,4) subtracts 2 from x (4\u21922) and 3 from y (4\u21921), arriving at (2,1) (B). The student's answer (1,2) (D) suggests they subtracted 3 from x (4\u21921) and 2 from y (4\u21922). This indicates they transposed the translation quantities between axes, applying 3 units left instead of 2 and 2 units down instead of 3. The misconception of mixing direction quantities directly explains this error - the student preserved the total number of moves (2+3=5) but misassigned them to axes. This differs from counting errors (which would produce coordinates like (3,2) if counting starting squares) or orientation errors (which don't affect coordinates). The error specifically stems from swapping the horizontal/vertical translation magnitudes while maintaining their sum.",
