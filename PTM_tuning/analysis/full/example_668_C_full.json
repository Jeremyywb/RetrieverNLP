  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The numbers 0 and 2 both occur twice, making them both modes. Since there are two modes, the correct answer is \"no mode\" (or bimodal if multimodal answers are accepted).\n\nIncorrect calculation: The student computed \\( \\frac{0+0+2+2}{4} = 1 \\), treating it as a mean problem instead of identifying frequent values.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student confused the definition of mode (most frequent value) with mean (average). They performed summation and division operations characteristic of mean calculations, despite the question explicitly asking for the mode.\n\nMisconception link: This error directly stems from conflating measures of central tendency - specifically, applying computational steps for mean when mode was required. The presence of two middle values (0 and 2) could suggest a median confusion, but the result 1 (a non-existent data point) confirms mean was calculated instead.\n\nDistinction: While median confusion could also yield 1 in this dataset (via \\( \\frac{0+2}{2} \\)), the explicit arithmetic averaging of all four numbers aligns uniquely with mean-mode confusion, not median-mode confusion.\n\nCritical evidence: The student's answer (1) isn't present in the original data, which is impossible for a mode but plausible for mean/median, confirming the misapplied concept.",
