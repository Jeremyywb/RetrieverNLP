  "explanation": "The correct lower bound calculation for 3.72 requires the first non-retained digit (thousandths place) to be 5:  \nMinimum \\( n = 3.72 - 0.005 = 3.715 \\)\n\nThe student likely subtracted 0.001 instead of 0.005:  \nIncorrect: \\( 3.72 - 0.001 = 3.719 \\)\n\nThe error stems from treating the thousandths place as requiring a full 0.009 adjustment (to force rounding up) rather than recognizing that a 5 in the third decimal suffices. This reflects a misunderstanding of how rounding thresholds work - any digit \u22655 in the truncated position triggers rounding, not just 9. \n\nThe student's calculation matches the misconception of assuming a 9 is needed to justify rounding, rather than understanding the 5-9 range. This distinguishes it from errors like improper subtraction of 0.005 (which would produce 3.715 - 0.005 = 3.710) or general rounding direction mistakes.",
