  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n2426.951 rounded to 1 decimal place requires examining the hundredths digit (5). Since 5 \u2265 5, the tenths digit (9) rounds up, becoming 10. This increments the units digit (6 \u2192 7), resulting in 2427.0.\n\nStudent's error:  \nThe student kept the tenths digit as 0 without incrementing the units digit, yielding 2426.0.\n\nReasoning flaw:  \nThe student recognized the 5 in the hundredths place but applied rounding-down logic (tenths digit remains 9) without accounting for the 9 \u2192 10 overflow. This caused them to treat the tenths digit as 0 while incorrectly leaving the units digit unchanged.\n\nMisconception link:  \nThe error directly stems from mishandling the 9 \u2192 10 transition during rounding, a failure to propagate the carry-over into the integer portion. This distinguishes it from simply misunderstanding place value or truncating decimals.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions:  \nUnlike errors where a student might ignore the 5 or misidentify the rounding digit, this specific mistake shows awareness of the 5 but improper handling of digit overflow, making it unique to the stated primary misconception.",
