  "explanation": "To factor \\( x^{2}+5 x+6 \\), we need two numbers that add to \\( 5 \\) (coefficient of \\( x \\)) and multiply to \\( 6 \\) (constant term). The student incorrectly stated the numbers must \"add to \\( 6 \\)\" and \"multiply to \\( 5 \\).\" \n\nThis error stems from reversing the roles of the coefficients. The student assigned the sum to the constant term (\\( 6 \\)) and the product to the \\( x \\)-term's coefficient (\\( 5 \\)), misapplying the relationship between the factors and the quadratic's structure. \n\nThe misconception directly caused the reversal: the student treated the constant term as the sum target and the linear coefficient as the product target. This distinguishes from related errors (e.g., misusing variables or factor pairs), as the core mistake is specifically swapping the additive and multiplicative requirements tied to the coefficients.",
