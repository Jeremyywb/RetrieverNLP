  "explanation": "The correct calculation is \\( 3^3 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27 \\). The student wrote \"33\", indicating they combined the base (3) and exponent (3) as adjacent digits. \n\nThe error stems from interpreting the exponent notation \\( 3^3 \\) as a two-digit numeral rather than an operation. Instead of multiplying 3 by itself three times, they concatenated the base and exponent values. \n\nThis matches the misconception of treating the exponent as a digit to append to the base, not as a count of multiplications. It differs from simply misplacing digits (e.g., writing \\( 3^3 = 33 \\)) versus errors like miscomputing \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\) but writing \"9\" or \"333\". The absence of any multiplication steps in the student's answer confirms the direct digit concatenation.",
