  "explanation": "The correct calculation maintains the first number whole while decomposing the second:  \n37 + 50 = 87 \u2192 87 + 6 = 93.  \nThe student instead decomposed both addends:  \n30 + 50 = 80 and 7 + 6 = 13 \u2192 80 + 13 = 93.  \n\nThe student misapplied the decomposition strategy by splitting both numbers into tens and ones separately rather than preserving the first number and breaking only the second. This reflects a failure to recognize that Ron's method specifically involves incrementally adding place values of one addend (e.g., 56 as 50 + 6) to the entire first number (37).  \n\nWhile the student's answer is numerically correct, their approach diverges structurally from Ron's method. The error aligns with incorrect separation/recombination of numbers, not with commutative property misunderstandings or carrying errors. The student prioritized place-value decomposition over sequential partial addition, altering the strategy's core mechanism.",
