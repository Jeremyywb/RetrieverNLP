  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires recognizing that an egg cup's capacity is the smallest volume (approximately 50-100 cm\u00b3). The student selected 197,177 cm\u00b3 (\u2248197 liters), which is orders of magnitude larger than realistic capacities for any listed object. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting \"which measurement matches\" as requiring the largest value rather than the smallest. The student likely associated \"egg cup\" with being the \"most\" in an undefined property (e.g., importance or frequency of use) instead of physical volume. This directly aligns with confusing \"least and most\" in quantitative comparisons. \n\nDistinct from estimation errors, the student correctly parsed numerical values but misapplied the comparative relationship between object size and volume. The error is rooted in flawed prioritization logic, not miscalculating the volumes themselves.",
