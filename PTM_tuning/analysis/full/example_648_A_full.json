  "explanation": "Correct expansion: \n(3y - 4)\u00b2 = (3y)(3y) + (3y)(-4) + (-4)(3y) + (-4)(-4)  \n= 9y\u00b2 - 12y - 12y + 16  \n= 9y\u00b2 - 24y + 16\n\nStudent's error:  \nOnly computed (3y)\u00b2 - 4\u00b2 = 9y\u00b2 - 16, omitting the cross terms.\n\nReasoning flaw:  \nThe student treated the square as a difference of squares (a - b)(a + b) instead of a binomial square (a - b)\u00b2. This caused them to skip the critical step of multiplying all term combinations, specifically the cross terms (-12y -12y).\n\nMisapplication:  \nBy failing to compute both (3y)(-4) and (-4)(3y), they neglected the middle term entirely. This aligns with the misconception of not multiplying all term combinations when expanding brackets.\n\nDistinction:  \nThis differs from \"mixing squaring and doubling\" because the error stems from omitting cross terms entirely, not miscalculating their coefficients. The negative result (-16) arises from misapplying subtraction to squared terms, not from misunderstanding negative multiplication.",
