  "explanation": "The correct factorization requires finding two numbers adding to 6 (coefficient of x) and multiplying to 5 (constant term): 1 and 5. This yields \\((x+1)(x+5)\\). \n\nThe student wrote \\(x(x+6)+5\\), which equals \\(x^2+6x+5\\) but isn't fully factorized. They split the expression into a product and a sum rather than a product of binomials. \n\nThe error occurred because the student didn't apply the method of identifying pairs of numbers with the required sum and product. Instead, they isolated \\(x\\) from \\(x^2+6x\\), leaving \\(x(x+6)\\), then added 5 separately. This reflects a failure to recognize that quadratic factorization requires decomposing the middle term into terms derived from factor pairs of the constant term.\n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of not knowing to find two numbers that add/multiply correctly, rather than errors about coefficient origins or overcomplication. The student's partial factoring demonstrates awareness of algebraic manipulation but lacks the specific quadratic factorization strategy.\n\nDistinct from related misconceptions: The answer isn't an incorrect product (like \\((x+2)(x+3)\\) from wrong number pairs), but a non-product form, showing absence of the required method rather than misapplication of it.",
