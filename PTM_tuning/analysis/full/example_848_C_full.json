  "explanation": "The correct LCM calculation multiplies all prime factors from both circles of the Venn diagram, using the highest power for each prime: \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\). \n\nThe student computed \\(2 \\times 5\\), excluding factors from the intersection (2, 3, 3). This suggests they interpreted the LCM as requiring only the unique factors from each set (the non-overlapping regions of the Venn diagram). \n\nThe error stems from incorrectly assuming the intersection\u2019s shared factors (common to both numbers) are excluded in LCM calculations. For LCM, all primes in the union of the sets are required, including those in the intersection. \n\nThis misconception differs from confusing LCM with HCF (which uses only the intersection) or misapplying set unions (which would include all elements). The student specifically omitted shared factors, treating LCM as a combination of exclusively unique primes rather than a union of all primes with maximum exponents.",
