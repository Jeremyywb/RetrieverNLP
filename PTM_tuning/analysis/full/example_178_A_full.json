  "explanation": "To compute \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of 24, the correct operation is \\( 24 \\div 6 = 4 \\). The student likely calculated \\( 24 - 6 = 18 \\), treating the fraction as a subtraction instruction rather than division. This error stems from misinterpreting the fraction bar as a subtraction operator instead of a division symbol. Specifically, they replaced \"divided by 6\" with \"minus 6\" at the critical step. This matches the primary misconception (confusing fraction notation with subtraction) rather than generic subtraction errors, as the subtracted value (6) directly corresponds to the denominator in the fraction. Other related misconceptions like subtracting an unrelated number or misplacing operands don't align with this precise substitution.",
