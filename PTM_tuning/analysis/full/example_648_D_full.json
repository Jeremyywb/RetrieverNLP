  "explanation": "The correct expansion requires applying the distributive property twice:\n(3y - 4)(3y - 4) = 3y(3y) + 3y(-4) + (-4)(3y) + (-4)(-4) = 9y\u00b2 -12y -12y +16 = 9y\u00b2 -24y +16.\n\nThe student stopped at (3y -4)(3y -4), failing to multiply the binomials. This shows they treated bracket removal as sufficient simplification, neglecting the distributive property application required for expansion. The error stems from believing that rewriting the squared term as repeated multiplication constitutes a complete simplification, not recognizing that operational execution (multiplying terms) is necessary. This directly matches the misconception \"Has removed brackets but not performed the operation,\" distinguishing it from errors in applying FOIL/distributive steps incorrectly (which would involve miscalculations in intermediate terms). The student's answer preserves structure but omits critical algebraic work.",
