  "explanation": "The correct representation uses an open circle at -1 (since \\( x < -1 \\) excludes -1) and a closed circle at 2 (since \\( x \\geq 2 \\) includes 2). The student reversed these markers, placing a closed circle at -1 and an open circle at 2. This indicates they conflated the inclusion/exclusion rules for the inequality symbols: they treated the strict inequality \\( < \\) as inclusive (adding a closed circle) and the non-strict inequality \\( \\geq \\) as exclusive (using an open circle). The error stems from misunderstanding how inequality symbols dictate endpoint inclusion, not from arrow directions or symbol confusion. This specific reversal aligns with misapplying the definitions of \"strict\" versus \"non-strict\" inequalities rather than general symbol misinterpretations.",
