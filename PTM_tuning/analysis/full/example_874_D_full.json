  "explanation": "The correct calculation uses tangent: \\( \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{10}{7} \\). The student likely assumed trigonometric ratios require all three sides (including the unlabeled hypotenuse) to be usable. They failed to recognize that the labeled sides (7 cm and 10 cm) are the legs of the triangle, directly providing the opposite and adjacent sides relative to \u03b8. This caused them to dismiss tangent as a viable option, incorrectly concluding no ratio applies. The error stems from misinterpreting the diagram\u2019s labels as incomplete, rather than recognizing the given sides\u2019 roles in the triangle. This distinguishes it from a general lack of question understanding, as the student specifically overlooked how the diagram\u2019s labels define the required components for trigonometric ratios.",
