  "explanation": "Correct calculation: From dash 2 (-6) to dash 11 (3), there are 9 intervals (11 - 2 = 9). Each interval equals 1 unit. The arrow is between dash 4 and 5, which are 2 intervals from dash 2: -6 + 2.5 = -3.5.\n\nStudent's error: The student likely calculated -6 + 5 = -1. This implies they counted 5 intervals from dash 2 instead of 2.5. \n\nSpecific flaw: The student miscounted the intervals between the labeled point (-6) and the arrow's position. They treated the arrow as being 5 intervals to the right of dash 2, adding 5 to -6, rather than correctly identifying it as 2.5 intervals away.\n\nConnection to misconception: This directly stems from misinterpreting the number line's scale by incorrectly counting divisions. The error isn't due to reversing direction or misreading labels but specifically miscounting how many intervals exist between the arrow and the labeled point.\n\nDistinction from related misconceptions: The error isn't caused by assuming larger absolute values are to the right (direction reversal) or mislabeling the entire scale but by a precise miscount of intervals from a known point.",
