  "explanation": "To calculate \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\), multiply numerators (\\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)) and denominators (\\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\)), yielding \\( \\frac{1}{24} \\). \n\nThe student likely computed \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\) correctly for the numerator but erroneously added \\(8 + 3 = 11\\) for the denominator, resulting in \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\). \n\nThe error stems from misapplying addition instead of multiplication to the denominators, while correctly multiplying numerators. This aligns with the misconception of adding denominators during fraction multiplication rather than multiplying them. \n\nDistinct from general \"adds instead of multiplies\" errors (which might affect both numerators and denominators), here only the denominators were mishandled. The operation on numerators remained correct, ruling out confusion with addition of fractions altogether.",
