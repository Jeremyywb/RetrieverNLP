  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nTables: 270\u00b0 (3/4 of circle), Chairs: 90\u00b0 (1/4 of circle)  \nRatio = 270:90 = 3:1\n\nStudent's Error:\nUsed 270/360 as the ratio\n\nReasoning Flaw:\nThe student treated the total circle degrees (360) as the chairs quantity instead of calculating chairs as (360 - 270) = 90\u00b0. This caused them to incorrectly pair tables (270) with the whole (360) rather than the actual chairs quantity.\n\nMisconception Link:\nThis directly stems from interpreting the denominator in a pie chart as one quantity instead of recognizing it as the total. The error specifically involves misallocating the total value rather than just misreading sections or creating fractions indiscriminately.\n\nDistinction:\nUnlike general pie chart misinterpretations, this error uniquely substitutes the total for one quantity. It's distinct from using section counts instead of values, as the student correctly used angle measures but misapplied them relationally.",
