  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(a^{2} \\times a = a^{2+1} = a^{3}\\)  \nStudent's error: \\(a^{2} \\times a = 3a\\)  \n\nThe student treated the exponents as coefficients to be summed (2 + 1 = 3) instead of applying the law of exponents for multiplication. This stems from conflating exponent rules with coefficient addition. Specifically, they interpreted the exponent in \\(a^{2}\\) as a numerical multiplier rather than a power, leading them to directly add 2 and 1 and write \\(3a\\).  \n\nThis error aligns with the misconception that cubing a term means multiplying it by 3, rather than applying repeated multiplication. It differs from related errors like adding terms (which would yield \\(a^{2} + a\\)) or multiplying the base and exponent (which would incorrectly give \\(a^{2}\\) if applied here).",
