  "explanation": "The correct calculation multiplies each rectangle's dimensions:\nTop area: \\(4(3x - 2) = 12x - 8\\)\nBottom area: \\(2(5x + 2) = 10x + 4\\)\nEquation: \\(12x - 8 = 10x + 4\\)\n\nThe student incorrectly computed:\nLeft side: \\(8 + 6x - 4\\) (equivalent to \\(4 \\cdot 2 + 3x \\cdot 2 - 2 \\cdot 2\\))\nRight side: \\(4 + 10x + 4\\) (equivalent to \\(2 \\cdot 2 + 5x \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2\\))\n\nThe error stems from multiplying terms across the two rectangles' dimensions (e.g., \\(4 \\cdot 2\\) and \\(3x \\cdot 2\\)) instead of computing each area separately. This indicates a failure to recognize that equal areas require independent calculation of each rectangle's area first. The student treated the problem as requiring cross-multiplication of unrelated terms from both rectangles, unlike simply adding dimensions (a related misconception) or misapplying distribution within a single expression.\n\nThe flaw aligns most closely with misapplying the distributive property in a multi-rectangle context, as the student incorrectly associated terms from separate rectangles during multiplication, rather than merely adding dimensions or mishandling parentheses.",
