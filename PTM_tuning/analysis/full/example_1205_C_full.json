  "explanation": "The correct answer requires recognizing that picking 'P' (a consonant) and picking a vowel cannot occur simultaneously, making them mutually exclusive. The student's answer (\"Probability events\") suggests they identified both as events involving probability but missed the critical relationship between them. \n\nThe flaw stems from not recalling the specific term for events that cannot co-occur, despite understanding both are probabilistic outcomes. This directly connects to the stated primary misconception of not knowing the term's definition. \n\nUnlike \"fails to consider all outcomes\" (which would involve miscalculating possibilities), the error here is purely terminological. The student labeled the events generically rather than applying the precise concept describing their relationship.",
