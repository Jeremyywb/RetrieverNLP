  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 28,902 + 100 = 29,002. This requires adding 1 to the hundreds place (8\u21929) while keeping other digits unchanged.\n\nStudent's error: 28,902 \u2192 2,890,200. This shows they appended two zeros to the original number (equivalent to multiplying by 100), not adding 100.\n\nSpecific flaw: The student interpreted \"100 more than\" as multiplication by 100 rather than addition. This caused them to perform 28,902 \u00d7 100 instead of 28,902 + 100.\n\nConnection to misconception: The error directly stems from confusing additive language (\"more than\") with multiplicative operations, a distinct issue from place value errors or carrying mistakes.\n\nDistinction: Related misconceptions about place value or carrying would produce answers like 28,902 + 100 = 28,002 (incorrect subtraction) or 28,902 + 100 = 28,9020 (appending digits without multiplication). The magnitude discrepancy here (100\u00d7 larger) uniquely indicates multiplication.",
