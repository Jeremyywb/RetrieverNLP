  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Blue (3/8) - White (1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4 of total bikes = 30\n- Total bikes = 30 \u00f7 (1/4) = 30 \u00d7 4 = 120\n\nStudent's likely incorrect calculation:\n- Treated the 30-bike difference as equal to one pie chart section (1/8 of total)\n- Total bikes = 30 \u00d7 8 = 240\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student incorrectly mapped the 30-bike difference to a single section rather than the actual 2-section difference (3 blue - 1 white). This caused them to multiply 30 by 8 sections instead of first dividing 30 by 2 to find each section's value.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThis directly matches the pattern of using a given difference as \"one part\" without dividing it by the actual number of fractional units it represents (2 sections here). It's distinct from part-whole confusion, as the error stems specifically from misinterpreting how many fractional units compose the difference.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nUnlike multiplication/division confusion, the core issue was misrepresenting the relationship between the stated difference (30) and the fraction segments it corresponds to.",
