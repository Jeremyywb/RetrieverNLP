  "explanation": "The correct answer requires shading all numbers greater than -1, represented by an open circle at -1 with a rightward arrow. The student's diagram shows an open circle at -1 but a leftward arrow. \n\nThe student correctly interpreted the open circle for strict inequality but misapplied the direction: \\( x > -1 \\) includes values increasing to the right on the number line. Their arrow points left, indicating \\( x < -1 \\), which reverses the inequality's direction. \n\nThis error stems from misaligning the inequality's \"greater than\" with the number line's direction. The student associated \"greater than\" with leftward movement, directly opposing the number line's inherent rightward increase. This matches the \"counts in the wrong direction\" misconception, not symbol reversal (they preserved \\( > \\)) or left-right confusion (they applied direction consistently, just inverted).",
