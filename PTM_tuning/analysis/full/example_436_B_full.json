  "explanation": "The correct calculation combines the negative numbers: \n\\( (-5) + (-2) = -7 \\)\n\nThe student likely computed:\n\\( 5 + 2 = 7 \\), omitting the negative signs entirely.\n\nThe error stems from treating both terms as positive numbers during addition, disregarding their negative values. This directly aligns with ignoring the inherent negativity of the addends, causing the result to lose its required sign. \n\nThe misconception differs from thinking \"the answer must be negative\" (which would preserve the negative sign) or misapplying sign rules (e.g., converting to subtraction). Here, the student eliminated the signs entirely during computation rather than misapplying operational rules.\n\nThis specific error shows no evidence of conflating addition with subtraction or misplacing sign effects, as the operation itself was executed as pure unsigned addition.",
