  "explanation": "The correct rotation requires a center at (-1,1), which Paul specifies. A 90\u00b0 anticlockwise rotation is equivalent to a +270\u00b0 rotation (since 360\u00b0-90\u00b0=270\u00b0 for clockwise equivalence), making both angle descriptions valid. However, Jo's answer lacks the correct center, while Paul's includes it. \n\nThe student likely assumed both answers used the origin as the center (a default assumption when none is stated). This led them to reject Paul's correct center (-1,1) as invalid and Jo's angle as incomplete, concluding neither was correct. \n\nThe error stems from overriding the explicitly stated center (-1,1) with an assumed origin. This directly aligns with the misconception of incorrectly assigning the center of rotation. \n\nIt differs from angle/direction misconceptions because the student would have accepted Paul's angle if they recognized the center, and reflection isn't indicated since both answers describe rotation.",
