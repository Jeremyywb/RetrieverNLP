  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 20\\% \\times 80 = 0.20 \\times 80 = 16 \\)\n\nStudent's likely steps: \\( 20 \\div 10 = 2 \\), then \\( 80 \\div 10 = 8 \\), stopping at this result\n\nCritical error: The student divided both the percentage (20) and the amount (80) by 10 independently, then treated the second division result as the final answer. This reflects a misunderstanding of percentage conversion - they conflated two separate operations (percentage scaling and amount scaling) instead of properly converting the percentage to a decimal multiplier.\n\nDistinction from related errors: Unlike misconceptions about dividing by 100 or finding 1%, this error specifically shows incorrect proportional scaling of both components (percentage and amount) through division by 10, rather than miscalculating conversion factors or percentage relationships. The error produces exactly half the correct answer because both components were improperly reduced by a factor of 10, then only one reduction was retained.",
