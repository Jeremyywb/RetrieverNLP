  "explanation": "The correct calculation applies division first then addition: \\( \\frac{n}{5} + 3 \\). The student instead computed \\( \\frac{n+3}{5} \\), adding before dividing. \n\nThe error stems from reversing the order of operations: the student performed addition first despite the function machine explicitly listing division followed by addition. This directly reflects a misconception where addition is prioritized over division in sequential steps, even when no parentheses or BIDMAS rules justify the inversion. \n\nThe flaw is specific to misordering the two given operations, not a general right-to-left execution (which would apply regardless of operation types) or a misunderstanding of BIDMAS hierarchy (which would not alter explicitly stated sequential steps). The error is isolated to reversing division and addition in this specific context.",
