  "explanation": "The correct solution requires solving \\(1 - 0.4x = 0\\) by isolating \\(x\\):  \n\\[\n1 = 0.4x \\implies x = \\frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5.\n\\]\nThe student incorrectly concluded \\(x = -0.4\\), directly equating the coefficient of \\(x\\) in \\(-0.4x\\) to the solution. This reflects a failure to apply inverse operations to isolate \\(x\\), instead misinterpreting the coefficient as the value satisfying the equation. The error aligns with confusing the coefficient with the x-intercept, as \\(-0.4\\) is the slope term, not the root. Distinguishing from related misconceptions: the student did not mistake the y-intercept (which is \\(1\\)) for the solution, nor did they merely copy the constant term. The flaw lies specifically in misattributing the role of the coefficient in the equation.",
