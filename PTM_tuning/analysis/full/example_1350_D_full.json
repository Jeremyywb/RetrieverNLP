  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n\\(40 \\times 7 = 280\\) (multiplying the tens from 42 with the ones from 27).  \n\nStudent's error:  \nLikely computed \\(40 \\times 70 = 2800\\), adding an extra zero to the 7.  \n\nReasoning flaw:  \nThe student treated both split components (40 and 7) as multiples of 10. They incorrectly scaled the 7 (originally in the ones place of 27) to 70, then multiplied \\(40 \\times 70\\). This shows a failure to preserve the place value of the original number's components when splitting for the grid.  \n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nUnlike simply ignoring zeros or multiplying non-zero digits, this error involves *adding* unwarranted zeros to non-multiples of 10. The student misapplied place value to both grid components rather than only mishandling one factor's zeros.  \n\nThe misconception directly caused the error by conflating the role of place value in the grid's partitioned numbers.",
