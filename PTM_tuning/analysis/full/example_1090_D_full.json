  "explanation": "The correct calculation combines like terms:\n6x - x = (6-1)x = 5x\n-2y + 3y = ( -2+3 )y = 1y\n\nThe student likely computed:\n6x - x as 6x + x = 7x (instead of 6x -1x)\n\nThis shows they treated the subtraction operator as a positive term addition. The error stems from misinterpreting \"-x\" as \"+x\" during combination rather than recognizing it as \"-1x\". This matches the misconception of handling subtraction like addition when grouping terms. It differs from sign association errors (which would affect adjacent terms) or coefficient omission (which would impact standalone variables).\n\nThe key divergence occurred when processing coefficients during subtraction, not when interpreting variable coefficients or sign placement.",
