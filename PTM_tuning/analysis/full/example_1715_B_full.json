  "explanation": "The correct method requires using the fraction template button \\(\\frac{\\square}{\\square}\\) after entering 3, which creates separate numerator/denominator slots. The student instead pressed \\(x^{-1}\\) after entering 3, which computes \\(3^{-1} = \\frac{1}{3}\\), then appended 7 to form \\(\\frac{1}{3}7\\) or \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\). The error stems from interpreting the reciprocal button as initiating a fraction where subsequent digits become the denominator, rather than understanding that \\(x^{-1}\\) acts immediately on the existing number. This directly conflates reciprocal operations with fraction structure creation, unlike related misconceptions about reciprocal definitions or exponent notation. The mistake specifically involves misassigning the purpose of the \\(x^{-1}\\) button rather than confusing reciprocals with powers.",
