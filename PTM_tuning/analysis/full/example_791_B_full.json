Ignored the remainder 1\n2. Directly divided the next digit (2) by 4: 2 \u00f7 4 = 0\n3. Wrote 0 as the next quotient digit instead of combining 1+2=12 first\n\nThe flaw stems from misapplying the long-division algorithm: They failed to combine the remainder with the next digit before dividing. This caused them to treat the isolated digit 2 (instead of 12) as the new dividend, leading to an invalid 0 quotient digit. This matches \"Does not divide correctly\" as they omitted the critical step of forming 12 from the remainder and next digit. It differs from \"subtracts instead of divides\" because the error occurred in dividend formation, not arithmetic operation choice. The 9 times table isn't relevant here, as 4\u00d72=8 was correctly calculated initially.",
