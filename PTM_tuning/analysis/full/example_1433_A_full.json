  "explanation": "Correct calculation:  \n\\( (-9) + (-4) = -(9 + 4) = -13 \\)\n\nIncorrect reasoning:  \nStudent likely calculated \\( -9 + 4 = -5 \\), treating the second negative as positive.\n\nSpecific flaw:  \nThe student incorrectly changed the second negative to a positive value before adding. Instead of combining both negatives (\\( -9 \\) and \\( -4 \\)), they subtracted 4 from 9, misapplying rules for mixed-sign operations to same-sign addition. This aligns with conflating addition of negatives with subtraction of positives.\n\nDistinction from related errors:  \nIf they had ignored signs entirely, the result would be \\( 13 \\). If they had only applied the negative to the first term, the calculation would match their error precisely (\\( -9 + 4 \\)), confirming this specific misstep.",
