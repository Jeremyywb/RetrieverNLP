  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( \\sqrt[3]{125} = 5 \\) because \\( 5^3 = 125 \\).\n\nStudent's error: They computed \\( \\frac{125}{3} \\) instead of identifying the number that cubes to 125.\n\nThe student misinterpreted the cube root operation as division by the index (3). This caused them to perform \\( 125 \\div 3 \\) rather than seeking the value \\( x \\) where \\( x^3 = 125 \\).\n\nThis error directly stems from conflating the notation\u2019s index with a divisor, not from misapplying exponentiation (e.g., cubing 125 or multiplying by 3, which would yield different wrong answers like \\( 125^3 \\) or \\( 375 \\)).\n\nThe distinction is clear: the student divided by the index, while related misconceptions like confusing roots with exponents or halving would produce entirely different incorrect results.",
