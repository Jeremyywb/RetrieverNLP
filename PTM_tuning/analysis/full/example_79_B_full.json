  "explanation": "The correct solution requires identifying where the parabola \\( y = x^2 - x - 6 \\) (opening upward) is above or on the x-axis. Factoring \\( (x-3)(x+2) \\geq 0 \\), the critical points are \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\). Since the parabola opens upward, \\( y \\geq 0 \\) occurs when \\( x \\leq -2 \\) (left of the left root) or \\( x \\geq 3 \\) (right of the right root). \n\nThe student incorrectly concluded \\( -2 \\leq x \\leq 3 \\), which corresponds to the interval where the parabola is below the x-axis. This error stems from misapplying the inequality direction relative to the parabola's orientation. The student likely assumed the solution lies between the roots, as one would for a downward-opening parabola or a \\( \\leq 0 \\) inequality, without accounting for the upward direction of this parabola. \n\nThis directly aligns with the misconception of selecting \\( y > a \\) solutions instead of \\( y < a \\) for quadratic inequalities, as the student reversed the inequality's interpretation based on the graph's shape. The error is distinct from union/intersection confusion, as the student's interval selection (rather than symbol misuse) reflects a misunderstanding of the parabola's relationship to the inequality.",
