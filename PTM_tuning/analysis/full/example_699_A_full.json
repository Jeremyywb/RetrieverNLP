  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nOriginal range: 40 cm (max) - 17 cm (min) = 23 cm\nAfter doubling: New max = 80 cm, new min = 34 cm \u2192 range = 46 cm (changes)\nAfter +12 cm: New max = 52 cm, new min = 29 cm \u2192 range = 23 cm (unchanged)\n\nStudent's flawed calculation:\nAssumed doubling heights would keep (40-17) unchanged. For example: (40\u00d72 - 17\u00d72) incorrectly treated as equivalent to (40-17) rather than 2\u00d7(40-17).\n\nSpecific reasoning flaw:\nThe student confused additive and multiplicative transformations. They treated doubling (a multiplicative change) as equivalent to adding a fixed value (an additive change) when assessing spread. This caused them to incorrectly assume range remains constant under scaling.\n\nHow misconception caused error:\nThe student failed to recognize that multiplying all values by 2 proportionally scales differences. They maintained the difference 40-17=23 after doubling, not realizing the actual difference becomes 2\u00d7(40-17)=46.\n\nDistinguishing from related misconceptions:\nThis isn't confusion about 100% vs. doubling (values were explicitly doubled), nor about additive changes affecting range (student correctly dismissed Katie's claim). The core error was equating multiplicative scaling with additive preservation of range.",
