  "explanation": "To factor \\( x^2 - 9 \\), the correct method uses the difference of squares formula: \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\). Here, \\( 9 = 3^2 \\), so the factorization is \\( (x - 3)(x + 3) \\).\n\nThe student wrote \\( (x - 3)^2 \\), which expands to \\( x^2 - 6x + 9 \\), not \\( x^2 - 9 \\). This error occurred because they treated the expression as a perfect square trinomial rather than a difference of squares. \n\nThe student incorrectly assumed the lack of a linear term implied both factors must be identical, neglecting the requirement for opposing signs in the binomials to eliminate the cross-term. This directly stems from conflating the structure of a squared binomial with the factorization pattern for a difference of two squares.\n\nThis explanation aligns with the misconception of misapplying squared binomial logic to a difference of squares, rather than errors like using the same sign in both brackets (which would yield \\( x^2 + 9 \\)) or failing to square-root the constant term entirely.",
