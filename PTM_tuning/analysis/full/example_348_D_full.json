  "explanation": "Correct calculation: 52 weeks \u00d7 7 days/week = 364 days, plus 1 day = 365.\n\nStudent's error: Answered 100 days. This suggests they may have appended \"100\" to a partial or misremembered value (e.g., interpreting \"365\" as \"3-6-5\" and adding \"100\" to the end, resulting in \"100\").\n\nSpecific flaw: The student treated numerical digits as separate entities to concatenate rather than a complete value. By inserting \"100\" at the end of a fragmented representation of 365 (e.g., \"3-6-5\" \u2192 \"3-6-5-100\"), they truncated or misinterpreted the final number as 100.\n\nDistinction: Unlike errors from miscalculating weeks/days (e.g., 50 weeks \u00d7 2 days = 100), this error specifically involves altering the numerical structure of the correct answer rather than misapplying calendar facts. The misconception focuses on numeral manipulation, not faulty multiplication or calendar knowledge.",
