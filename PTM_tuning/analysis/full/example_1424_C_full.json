  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(4 \\times 3 + 2 = 14\\), resulting in \\(\\frac{14}{3}\\).\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation: \\(4 \\times 2 + 3 = 11\\), leading to \\(\\frac{11}{3}\\).\n\nThe student multiplied the whole number (4) by the numerator (2) instead of the denominator (3), then added the denominator (3) instead of the numerator (2). This reflects a misapplication of the conversion steps, where the roles of the numerator and denominator in the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) were reversed during both multiplication and addition. The error stems from conflating the components of the fractional part with their functions in the conversion process. \n\nThis specific flaw aligns with confusing which part of the fraction interacts with the whole number during multiplication and which is added afterward. It is distinct from forgetting to add the numerator (which would yield \\(12/3\\)) or merely adding instead of multiplying (e.g., \\(4 + 2 = 6\\)), as the student performed both operations but with inverted components.",
