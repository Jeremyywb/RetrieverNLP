  "explanation": "To measure 325\u00b0, the reflex angle is calculated as 360\u00b0 - 35\u00b0 (acute angle). The correct diagram shows the acute angle at 35\u00b0 (inner scale between 40-30), leading to 325\u00b0.\n\nThe student's diagram shows the acute angle at 25\u00b0 (inner scale between 30-20), calculating 360\u00b0 - 25\u00b0 = 335\u00b0. \n\nThe error occurred when reading the inner scale: the student identified the halfway point between 30-20 as 25\u00b0 instead of recognizing the correct halfway point between 40-30 as 35\u00b0. This specific misreading of the protractor's numerical markings (despite using the correct inner scale for reflex angles) directly caused the 10\u00b0 error. \n\nThis aligns with \"correct scale but wrong value\" rather than other misconceptions like using the outer scale or failing to subtract from 360\u00b0, as the student properly utilized the reflex angle method but erred in scale interpretation.",
