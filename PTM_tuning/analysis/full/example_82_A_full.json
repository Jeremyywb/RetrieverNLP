  "explanation": "The correct inequality \\(x > 9\\) positions \\(x\\) on the open side of the symbol, indicating it is the larger value. The student wrote \\(x < 9\\), reversing the direction of the inequality symbol. This error stems from misinterpreting the relationship between the inequality's direction and the phrase \"greater than.\" The student likely associated the phrase with the numerical value \\(9\\) rather than the variable \\(x\\), causing them to invert the symbol to point toward \\(9\\) as the fixed value. This aligns with inverting the solution direction while retaining the symbol's basic shape, not confusion about equality/inequality distinctions or arbitrary reversal. Related misconceptions like symbol confusion (e.g., mistaking \\(>\\) for \\(=\\)) are ruled out, as the symbol was correctly identified as an inequality but misapplied in direction.",
