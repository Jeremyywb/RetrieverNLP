  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n1. Identify GCF of 9y\u00b2 and 4y \u2192 y\n2. Factor out y: y(9y + 4)\n3. Thus, \u2b24 = 4\n\nStudent's incorrect calculation:\n1. Factored out y: y(9y + 4y)\n2. Resulted in \u2b24 = 4y\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student failed to divide the second term by the factored GCF. When factoring y from 4y, they kept \"y\" instead of performing 4y \u00f7 y = 4. This shows they treated factoring as removing a visible \"y\" symbol rather than applying division to both terms. The error stems from misapplying the factoring process after correctly identifying the GCF. It differs from GCF identification errors because they successfully extracted y initially, but mishandled its division from the second term. Related misconceptions like partial bracket expansion don't apply here, as the error occurred during factorization steps, not multiplication.",
