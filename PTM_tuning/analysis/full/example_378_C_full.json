  "explanation": "The correct calculation converts all numbers to decimals:\n- \\( \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \\)\nResulting in: \\( 0.4, \\, 0.25, \\, 2.5, \\, 0.4 \\). The mode is \\( 0.4 \\), equivalent to \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly identified two modes (\\( 0.4 \\) and \\( 2.5 \\)), likely because they converted \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) to \\( 2.5 \\) instead of \\( 0.4 \\). This suggests they placed the denominator (5) directly after the numerator (2) as a decimal, misapplying fraction-to-decimal conversion rules. \n\nBy erroneously converting \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) to \\( 2.5 \\), the student perceived two unique instances of \\( 2.5 \\) (original and converted) and one \\( 0.4 \\), leading them to claim both as modes. This directly aligns with the misconception of placing the denominator after the decimal point, rather than performing division. \n\nThis error differs from decimal comparison issues or decimal point misplacement, as the student explicitly altered the fraction's structure instead of miscalculating its division.",
