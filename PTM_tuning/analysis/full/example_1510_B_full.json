  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n0.04 \u00d7 21 = (4 \u00d7 21) \u00f7 100 = 84 \u00f7 100 = 0.84\n\nStudent's likely steps:\n4 \u00d7 21 = 84 \u2192 placed decimal to get 8.04\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student treated 0.04 as 4 and 21 as 201 (adding an implicit zero), multiplying 4\u00d7201=804. They then incorrectly inserted a decimal to match 0.04's two decimal places, resulting in 8.04 instead of 0.84. This shows they ignored the decimal's position in 0.04 and misapplied place value when multiplying.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThis isn't a carrying error (no digits exceeded 9) nor a simple \u00d710 error (8.04 isn't exactly 10\u00d70.84). The core issue was treating digits separately from their actual values in the decimal system.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nBy disregarding 0.04's place value as hundredths and 21's tens/ones structure, the student performed digit-wise multiplication without proper alignment, directly causing the decimal misplacement.",
