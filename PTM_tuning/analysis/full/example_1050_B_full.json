  "explanation": "The correct factorization requires factoring out the HCF (6) from both terms:\n18a \u00f7 6 = 3a  \n-12 \u00f7 6 = -2  \nResult: 6(3a - 2)\n\nThe student incorrectly factored out 18 (which only divides the first term) and altered the second term arbitrarily:\n18a \u00f7 18 = a  \n-12 \u2192 -6 (not derived through division by 18)  \nResult: 18(a - 6)\n\nThe error stems from treating 18 as a valid common factor despite it not dividing 12, then adjusting the constant term through subtraction rather than division. This violates the requirement to use a true common divisor and maintain equivalence through inverse operations. The misconception focuses on improper factor selection and arithmetic manipulation, distinct from related errors like partial factoring or proportional adjustment failures, as the student attempted full factorization with an invalid common element.",
