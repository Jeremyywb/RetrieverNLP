  "explanation": "The correct three-letter angle notation places the vertex (E) in the middle. The marked interior angle at E is formed by sides EA and EF, making it \u2220AEF. The student answered \"E\" alone, omitting the two adjacent points. This indicates they conflated the vertex label with the full angle notation, failing to recognize that three letters are required to uniquely identify the angle's sides. The misconception about angle notation (requiring only the vertex) directly caused this error, as opposed to related issues like misidentifying interior angles or choosing incorrect adjacent letters. The error specifically stems from incomplete notation understanding, not confusion about angle measurement or side labeling.",
