  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 13 \\)\n\nStudent's calculation: \\( 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 10 \\)\n\nThe student omitted the \"Other\" category's frequency (3) in their summation. This indicates they stopped adding after the fourth row without completing the calculation for all categories. The error stems from failing to recognize that every listed category's frequency must be included, regardless of its position in the table. This directly aligns with the misconception of not completing all required calculations in a multi-step problem. It is distinct from other listed misconceptions because the student correctly identified numerical frequencies but failed to process all rows, rather than misinterpreting categories as numerical values or ignoring digit formats.",
