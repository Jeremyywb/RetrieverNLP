  "explanation": "Correct Calculation:\nThe angle marked \\(78^\\circ\\) and \\(t\\) are corresponding angles formed by the transversal intersecting two parallel lines. Corresponding angles are equal, so \\(t = 78^\\circ\\).\n\nStudent's Incorrect Calculation:\nThe student likely subtracted \\(78^\\circ\\) from \\(360^\\circ\\): \\(360^\\circ - 78^\\circ = 282^\\circ\\).\n\nSpecific Flaw:\nThe student treated the angles as if they formed a full rotation around a single point where the transversal intersects a line. However, \\(78^\\circ\\) and \\(t\\) are at different intersections (upper vs. lower line). This misapplication of the \"angles around a point sum to \\(360^\\circ\\)\" rule caused the error.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions:\nIf the student had confused co-interior or corresponding angles, they might have added angles to \\(180^\\circ\\) or used the wrong angle pair relationship. The error specifically stems from incorrectly applying a full-circle angle sum to non-adjacent angles.",
