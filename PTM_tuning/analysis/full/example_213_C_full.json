  "explanation": "The reciprocal of \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\) is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{3}} = -3 \\). The student likely converted \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\) to its reciprocal by inverting the fraction to \\( 3 \\) but omitted the negative sign. \n\nThe error stems from treating the reciprocal operation as affecting only the magnitude of the number, not its sign. The student correctly inverted the numerator and denominator of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) but failed to retain the original negative sign during this process. This reflects a direct omission of the negative sign in the reciprocal calculation, rather than a miscalculation involving sign rules for multiplication or improper sign placement. \n\nThe error is distinct from misconceptions like misapplying sign rules during multiplication (e.g., believing negatives cancel) or misplacing the sign in the result, as the negative was entirely disregarded rather than mishandled.",
