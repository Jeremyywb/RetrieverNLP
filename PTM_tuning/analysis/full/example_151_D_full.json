  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n- Term 3: 4 + 10 = 14\n- Term 4: 10 + 14 = 24\n\nIncorrect calculation:\n- Term 2: 4 \u00d7 3 - 2 = 10 (matches)\n- Term 3: 10 \u00d7 3 - 2 = 28 \u2260 14 (error here)\n\nThe student stopped verifying after the first successful application of their rule. They misapplied a linear operation (3n-2) that only worked for the initial term pair but ignored subsequent terms. This indicates they focused on finding a single-step transformation between consecutive terms rather than recognizing the cumulative relationship between prior terms. The error aligns with applying one-step operations without testing consistency across multiple terms, distinct from confusion about Fibonacci definitions. Related misconceptions like position-to-term confusion are irrelevant here, as the error stems from incomplete pattern verification rather than rule-type misclassification.",
