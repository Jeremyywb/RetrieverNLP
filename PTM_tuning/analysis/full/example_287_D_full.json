  "explanation": "The correct analysis shows days (a simple time unit) and km/h (a speed unit containing time in denominator). The student rejected both, indicating they treated km/h's time component as disqualifying it from being a time unit, while also failing to recognize days' validity. This suggests they conflated derived units (like speed) with fundamental units, incorrectly assuming any unit involving time division (km/h) or aggregation (days) was invalid. The primary misconception caused them to misclassify km/h while extending flawed logic to dismiss days, despite days being a standalone time measure. This differs from merely not recognizing km as length, as the error stems from misapplying unit composition rules rather than component identification.",
