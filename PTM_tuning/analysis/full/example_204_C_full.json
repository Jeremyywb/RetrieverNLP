  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\n204050 = 204 (thousands place) + 050 (ones place) = \"Two hundred and four thousand and fifty\"\n\nStudent's incorrect steps:\n- Read digits as separate components: 200 + 4 + 50\n- Combined them as \"Two hundred and four and fifty\"\n\nSpecific flaw:\nThe student failed to recognize that the digits \"204\" occupy the hundred thousands, ten thousands, and thousands place values (forming 204,000), not separate hundreds and ones places. They treated \"204\" as a standalone number (200+4) rather than 204 multiplied by 1,000.\n\nConnection to misconception:\nThis shows confusion about how digit groupings correspond to place value magnitudes. The error stems from not associating the three-digit group before the comma with thousands units, not from misidentifying individual digit positions like ten thousands vs thousands.\n\nDistinction from related errors:\nThe mistake isn't about swapping adjacent place values (e.g., ten thousands vs thousands) but rather failing to process the entire thousands unit (204\u00d71000) and instead reading digits as additive components across multiple place value scales.",
