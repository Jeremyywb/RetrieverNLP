  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\( 4000 \\, \\text{m} \\div 1000 = 4 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\nStudent's error: \\( 4000 \\, \\text{m} \\div 10 = 400 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\nThe student incorrectly divided by 10 instead of 1000, indicating they believed 1 km equals 10 meters. This stems from misapplying the metric prefix \"kilo-\" as representing a factor of 10 rather than its actual value of 1000. \n\nTheir reasoning conflated the decimal shifts required for smaller unit conversions (e.g., meters to decimeters) with the larger shift needed for kilometers. Unlike the related misconception of dividing by 100 (which would yield 40 km), this error reflects a more extreme misunderstanding of the scale difference between meters and kilometers.\n\nThe direct link to the error is the student's flawed interpretation of the relationship between base units and prefixes, not merely an arithmetic mistake or confusion with other metric subdivisions like hectometers.",
