  "explanation": "Correct Approach:\n1. Calculate midpoints of diagonals. Midpoint between (0,3) and (2,-3) is ((0+2)/2, (3+(-3))/2) = (1,0).\n2. Set midpoint of other diagonal (4,-1) and missing vertex (x,y) equal to (1,0):\n   (4+x)/2 = 1 \u2192 x = -2\n   (-1+y)/2 = 0 \u2192 y = 1\n3. Result: (-2,1)\n\nStudent's Error:\nThey likely calculated:\n1. Midpoint of vertical side between (4,-1) and (4,1) as (4,0)\n2. Incorrectly assumed this midpoint matches the vertical side between (0,3) and (2,-3) (midpoint (1,0)) by only adjusting y: (-1 + y)/2 = 0 \u2192 y = 1\n3. Kept x=4 from (4,-1) without verifying diagonal midpoints\n\nFlawed Reasoning:\nThe student correctly balanced the y-coordinate to force vertical symmetry but retained the x=4 from a given point instead of enforcing diagonal midpoint equivalence. This reflects a focus on individual side properties rather than the critical rectangle property that diagonals must share a midpoint. They prioritized coordinate replication over systemic validation of all constraints.\n\nDistinction:\nUnlike general \"wrong x-coordinate\" errors, this specifically shows partial application of midpoint logic (to vertical sides) while neglecting diagonal bisection - a more nuanced misunderstanding than simply selecting random coordinates or misapplying length equality.",
