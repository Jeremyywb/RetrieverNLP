  "explanation": "The expression \\( 3p + 7 \\) contains no equality sign, making it an algebraic expression. The symbol \\( p \\) represents an unknown quantity, classifying it as a variable. The student incorrectly labeled \\( p \\) as an \"equation,\" implying they conflated the entire expression with an equation. This error stems from misidentifying an expression (a combination of terms) as an equation (which requires equality between two expressions). The misconception directly substitutes \"equation\" for \"expression\" when describing the context of \\( p \\), rather than confusing variables with terms or formulas. Related misconceptions like confusing variables with formulas or terms with equations do not apply here, as the error specifically misclassifies the expression's nature.",
