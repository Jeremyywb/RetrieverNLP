  "explanation": "The red line is horizontal (y=2), and the y-axis is vertical (x=0). Perpendicular lines intersect at 90\u00b0, which occurs here. The student incorrectly labeled the line as \"equidistant\" to the y-axis. \n\nThe error stems from interpreting the line's position (stretching equally from x=-2 to x=2) as meaning all points are equally distant from the y-axis. However, equidistance requires every point on the line to have the same distance to the axis, which is false here (e.g., (-2,2) is 2 units left, (2,2) is 2 units right, but intermediate points have smaller distances). \n\nThe student conflated symmetry across the y-axis (equal maximum distances at endpoints) with uniform distance across the entire line. This directly aligns with the primary misconception of misapplying \"equidistant\" to describe positional symmetry rather than geometric orientation. \n\nThis differs from confusing \"perpendicular\" with \"parallel\" or \"vertical,\" as the error centers on distance, not orientation terminology. The student's focus on spatial balance, not slope relationships, distinguishes this from the listed related misconceptions.",
