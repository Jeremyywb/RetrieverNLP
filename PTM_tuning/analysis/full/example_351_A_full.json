  "explanation": "Correct calculation: \\(16^2 = 16 \\times 16 = 256\\).  \nStudent's calculation: \\(16 \\div 2 = 8\\).  \n\nThe student incorrectly replaced the squaring operation (\\(16 \\times 16\\)) with halving (\\(16 \\div 2\\)). This stems from misinterpreting the exponent \"2\" as a directive to divide by 2 instead of multiplying the base by itself.  \n\nThe error directly corresponds to conflating the action of squaring with simple division by 2, rather than errors like dividing by the exponent (which would produce the same result here but reflect a different misunderstanding of exponents) or confusing square roots with doubling. The specific substitution of division for exponentiation aligns with a fundamental misassociation between the symbol and the required operation.",
