  "explanation": "The correct calculation recognizes each term increases by 2 boxes:  \nTerm 1 = 3, Term 2 = 3 + 2 = 5, Term 3 = 5 + 2 = 7.  \n\nThe student likely reasoned:  \nTerm 1 = 3, then noticed the addition of 2 boxes to form Term 2, but concluded the term's value equals the number of boxes *added* (2) rather than the total (3 + 2).  \n\nThe flaw stems from interpreting the term-to-term rule (add 2) as the term's absolute value instead of applying it cumulatively. This directly misattributes the incremental change to the term's identity.  \n\nThis differs from related misconceptions like missing pattern changes or referencing prior terms, as the error specifically substitutes the rule's magnitude for the term's value.",
