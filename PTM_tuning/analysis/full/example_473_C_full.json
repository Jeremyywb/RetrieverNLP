  "explanation": "Correct calculation: The digit 3 occupies the thousands place in 43075, giving 3\u00d71000=3000.\n\nStudent's error: Calculated 3\u00d710=30 instead.\n\nFlaw explanation: The student correctly identified the digit but assigned it to the tens place rather than thousands. This indicates they likely counted positions from the left (misinterpreting the second digit as tens) rather than recognizing place values increase right-to-left. \n\nMisconception link: This directly corresponds to mislocating the digit's positional value by three places (thousands\u2192tens), resulting in a 100\u00d7 underestimation. \n\nDistinction: Unlike confusing adjacent columns (e.g., thousands vs ten thousands), this error reflects a systemic misunderstanding of right-to-left place value progression. The 30 answer also rules out zero-counting errors or ones-place confusion.",
