  "explanation": "Correct calculation:\nLet input = x\nFunction: x + \u2153 = 7\nSolution: x = 7 - \u2153 = 6\u2154\n\nStudent's calculation:\n7 \u00f7 3 = 7/3\n\nFlaw explanation:\nThe student incorrectly applied division as the inverse operation for addition. When reversing \"add \u2153,\" they divided the output by 3 instead of subtracting \u2153. This stems from misidentifying inverse operations for addition. While subtraction reverses addition, the student erroneously treated division as the inverse. This specific error matches the misconception of substituting division for subtraction when reversing operations, distinct from simply swapping input/output or keeping the original output unchanged. The error pattern aligns with applying a fundamentally incorrect inverse operation type rather than a simple sequence reversal.",
