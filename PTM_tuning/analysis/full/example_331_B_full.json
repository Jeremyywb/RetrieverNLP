  "explanation": "The correct calculation shows \\( 9^{0} = 1 \\), as any non-zero base raised to the 0 power equals 1.  \nThe student likely computed \\( 9 \\times 0 = 0 \\), treating the exponent as a multiplicative factor.  \nThis error stems from misinterpreting the exponential notation \\( 9^{x} \\) as requiring multiplication of the base by the exponent rather than repeated multiplication of the base.  \nThe misconception directly maps to confusing the operation \\( a^{n} \\) (which means \\( a \\times a \\times \\dots \\times a \\)) with \\( a \\times n \\), specifically replacing the exponentiation with scalar multiplication.  \nThis differs from the related misconception of \"writes a variable to the power of \\( n \\) as \\( nx \\)\" because the error here involves a numerical base (9) rather than a variable, and specifically applies to the \\( x=0 \\) case.  \nThe error is not caused by symmetry assumptions or zero-product properties, as those would manifest differently in other positions of the table.",
