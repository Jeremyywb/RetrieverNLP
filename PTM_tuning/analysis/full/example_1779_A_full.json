  "explanation": "Correct Calculation: A cuboid has 8 vertices, calculated by recognizing it has 12 edges and 6 faces, with each vertex being the intersection of three edges.\n\nStudent's Error: The student likely counted visible edges or faces in a 2D representation. For example, they might have seen a front face (4 edges) and two side edges connecting front/back, totaling 6 \"points,\" misinterpreting these as vertices.\n\nSpecific Flaw: The student incorrectly equated the number of edges or junctions visible in a 2D projection to the total 3D vertices, neglecting hidden vertices and the 3D structure.\n\nMisconception Link: This aligns with the misconception that 2D cross-sectional properties (like edge count) directly map to 3D properties. The student assumed the visible 2D features (e.g., 6 edge endpoints) represented all vertices.\n\nDistinction from Related Misconceptions: Unlike confusing cubes/cuboids (both have 8 vertices) or tetrahedrons (irrelevant to 6), this error stems from misapplying 2D observations to 3D geometry.",
