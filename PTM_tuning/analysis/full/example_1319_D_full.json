  "explanation": "The correct sequence \\( n, n+1, n+2 \\) increases by 1 between terms, ensuring consecutive integers. The student's answer \\( n, n+2, n+4 \\) adds 2 between terms, producing numbers separated by 2 (e.g., 5,7,9). \n\nThe error stems from misidentifying the required difference for consecutive numbers. The student assumed a constant difference of 2 satisfies \"consecutive,\" neglecting that consecutive integers must differ by 1. This directly aligns with misunderstanding the term \"consecutive\" as allowing any fixed interval rather than requiring adjacent integers. \n\nThe flaw is distinct from confusing primes (irrelevant here) or checking only one pair (both gaps in the student's sequence are incorrect). The error persists across all terms, confirming a conceptual misunderstanding of the definition rather than partial pattern recognition.",
