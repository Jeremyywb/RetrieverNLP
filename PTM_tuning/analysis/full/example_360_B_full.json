  "explanation": "Correct calculation: Order the data: \\(-15, 2, 2, 4, 7, 10\\). The median is the average of the 3rd and 4th terms: \\(\\frac{2+4}{2} = 3\\).\n\nIncorrect approach: Using the original unordered sequence \\(2,2,4,7,10,-15\\), the student likely identified the middle terms as the 3rd and 4th positions (4 and 7) but incorrectly selected 4 instead of averaging them. \n\nThe flaw stems from failing to sort the data before locating the middle values. This caused the student to treat the original 3rd term (4) as the median, assuming positional centrality without numerical ordering. \n\nThis directly aligns with the primary misconception of not ordering data, as the error disappears when sorting is performed. It differs from mean/mode errors because the student's answer matches a positional selection, not a calculated average or most frequent value.",
