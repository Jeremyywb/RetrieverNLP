  "explanation": "The correct calculation involves finding the LCM of 12 and 8. Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36\u2026; multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24\u2026 The first common multiple is 24. \n\nThe student added 12 + 8 = 20, treating the problem as requiring a sum rather than a repeated interval. \n\nThe error stems from misinterpreting the relationship between the drip intervals. Instead of identifying a shared multiple (a time where both sequences align), the student combined the values directly. This reflects a failure to recognize that recurring events syncing require multiples, not additive totals. \n\nThis differs from selecting a common factor (e.g., 4), as the student explicitly performed addition rather than division. The misconception specifically involves confusing summation with periodic alignment, distinct from errors about factors or definitions of \"multiple.\"",
