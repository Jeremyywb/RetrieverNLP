  "explanation": "Correct LCM calculation: \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 5\\) (all primes from both circles with maximum exponents)\nStudent's calculation: \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 3\\) (only primes from the intersection)\n\nThe student multiplied only the shared prime factors in the Venn diagram's intersection, failing to include the unique prime factor 5 from the 90-set and the additional 2 from the 36-set. This occurred because they treated the intersection's primes as the complete set for LCM calculation, ignoring that LCM requires the union of all primes with maximum exponents. \n\nWhile related misconceptions involve missing individual factors, the core error stems from conflating LCM with GCD logic - using common primes (intersection) rather than combining all primes (union). This distinguishes it from errors like omitting a single common factor or misinterpreting set membership.",
