  "explanation": "The correct calculation evaluates \\(27^{\\frac{4}{3}}\\) as \\((27^{\\frac{1}{3}})^4 = 3^4 = 81\\). \n\nThe student likely computed \\(27^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 3\\) (correctly identifying the cube root) but then multiplied \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) instead of calculating \\(3^4\\). \n\nThis indicates they misinterpreted the fractional exponent's numerator as a multiplier rather than a power. After resolving the root (denominator), they erroneously performed multiplication by 4 instead of exponentiation to the 4th power. \n\nThis error aligns with misapplying the exponent's components sequentially as operations (root then multiplication) rather than as nested operations (root then power). It differs from multiplying the base and exponent directly (e.g., \\(27 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\)) or reversing the order of operations, as the root was correctly calculated first. \n\nThe flaw stems from treating the exponent as separate additive steps rather than a combined multiplicative relationship.",
