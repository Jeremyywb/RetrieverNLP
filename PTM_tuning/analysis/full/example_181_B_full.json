  "explanation": "The correct calculation requires subtracting Saturday's potato consumption from Sunday's. For instance, if Sunday was 17.5 kg and Saturday 7.5 kg, the difference is \\(17.5 - 7.5 = 10\\) kg. \n\nThe student likely added the two values: \\(17.5 + 7.5 = 25\\) kg. \n\nThe error stems from using addition to compute the difference between two quantities instead of subtraction. The misconception that addition is appropriate for determining differences caused the student to sum the values rather than subtract them. \n\nThis directly aligns with the primary misconception of adding instead of subtracting for differences, as opposed to misreading graph axes or incomplete calculations. The error is purely an arithmetic operation mismatch, not a graph interpretation issue.",
