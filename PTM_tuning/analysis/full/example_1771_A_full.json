  "explanation": "To compare \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) and \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\), we convert to a common denominator:  \n\\( \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{8} \\), which is greater than \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\).  \n\nThe student likely compared numerators 3 and 5 directly without standardizing denominators, treating the fractions as whole-number counts. This error occurs when interpreting fractions as absolute quantities (e.g., \"3 parts\" vs. \"5 parts\") rather than proportional values dependent on denominator size.  \n\nThe misconception stems from visualizing separate fraction models (e.g., 3 shaded segments in a circle divided into 4 vs. 5 segments in a circle divided into 8), leading to an invalid comparison of raw counts instead of equivalent units. This differs from misunderstanding equivalent fractions, as the error isn\u2019t a simplification mistake but a failure to establish comparable terms through common denominators or cross-multiplication.",
